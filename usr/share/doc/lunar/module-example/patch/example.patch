# This is not a real patch file, but in this directory (patch) you could
# have placed diffs that will automatically be applied to the source tree.
#

# note there are right ways to make diffs and wrong ones, as a general rule
# you need to include the full source dir. The patch will be applied by
# the command patch -p1 < $filename.

# also please make unidiffs! (diff -u)
