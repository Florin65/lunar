.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I lunar is an easy\-to\-use menu\-driven (dialog\-based) interface to the .I lunar source\-based package management system.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.I lunar
without options will start the menu\-driven package management utility.
.PP 
.I update
.IP 
automatically updates all installed software packages. This option is non\-interactive and does not start up the menu\-driven interface. It is suitable for use in cron jobs.
.PP 
.I renew
.IP 
check installed versions of sources against the moonbase, and recompile where necessary. This is the same as the final stage of a lunar update.
.PP 
.I rebuild
.IP 
automatically rebuilds all installed software packages. This option is non\-interactive and does not start up the menu\-driven interface. It is suitable for use in cron jobs and is useful for rebuilding distributed binaries from source.
<pp>
.I optimize
.IP 
jump straight into the compiler optimizations menu.
.PP 
.I prune
.IP 
Removes all old source code and old backups. Since the number of sources on the system grows steadily on a running system, you will need to clean some of the kept copies of sources and compile caches. The source code from previous versions are kept so that the packages can be rolled back to older versions. This does not delete sources that are up to date,
but not installed.
