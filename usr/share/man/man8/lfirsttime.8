.IX Title "lfirsttime 8"
.TH lfirsttime 8 "2005-03-08" "Moritz Heiber" "Lunar Linux for the first time"
.SH "NAME"
lfirsttime \- or 'What to do after a successful installation?'
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
This manual page has been written in order to ease the life of the system administrator after the installation part of \fBLunar Linux\fR.
.SH "DO NOT PANIC!"
.IX Header "DO NOT PANIC!"
These are the suggested tasks you should accomplish immediately after the first boot of a newly installed Lunar box.
.PP
All of the lunar related commands mentioned below either feature a whole manpage or at least a very useful helpscreen. If you need immediant assistance regarding any of those commands, issue:
.PP
\&\fBman 'command'\fR or \fB'command' \-\-help\fR
.PP
at your console.
.PP
The operations described below follow a strict logic and they should be executed in sequence.
.PP
\&\fBPlease remember that the Lunar Install/Rescue \s-1ISO\s0 is not a full featured system.\fR
.SH "NETWORK SETTINGS"
.IX Header "NETWORK SETTINGS"
This step is crucial to your future success with \fBLunar Linux\fR. If you haven't set up your network card yet try it with \fBlnet\fR. Remember, you need to know about your current network card's driver and have the kernel built the appropriate modules for it.
.Sh "Check your network settings"
.IX Subsection "Check your network settings"
Once you've set up your network card correctly, try to ping out.
.PP
Example: \fBping google.com\fR
.PP
If it doesn't work you may be having a name resolution problem, try pinging to the \s-1IP\s0 address instead of the name.
.PP
Example: \fBping 216.239.57.99\fR
.PP
If pinging to \s-1IP\s0 is working but pinging to name fails, check the \fB/etc/resolv.conf\fR file and see if the nameserver entries are there. You may also want to check the man page, \fBman resolv.conf\fR if you are not familiar with the entries which should be in that file.
.Sh "Check the network device"
.IX Subsection "Check the network device"
If pinging the \s-1IP\s0 address fails, check to see if your network interface is up and running. You may use the command \fBifconfig\fR to see the interface's status. You must be able to see the details of your network interface in the output of ifconfig.
.PP
If you cannot, then check if your \fB\s-1NIC\s0 (network interface card)\fR module is loaded (assuming you are using a modular kernel); use the command \fBlsmod\fR to see the already loaded modules and see wether the module for your network card is already loaded.
.PP
If you do not know for sure what type of network card you have try executing the command: \fBcat /proc/pci|grep Ethernet\fR or \fBlspci\fR.  This should give the manufacturer and model name of your ethernet card.
.PP
If your \s-1NIC\s0 module is there but your interface is not up, reconfigure the interface with \fBlnet\fR and test again.  If your \s-1NIC\s0 module is still not listed in the output of \fBlsmod\fR, the chances are you have misconfigured the kernel or misconfigured your network.  To check the kernel modules, try \fBls \-l /lib/modules/`uname \-r`/kernel/drivers/net\fR to see the network modules available with the current kernel. If the your \s-1NIC\s0's kernel module doesn't show up you probably have to reconfigure and recompile your current kernel to include the appropriate module(s).
.Sh "lnet or manual configuration"
.IX Subsection "lnet or manual configuration"
Your network setting can be configured completely using \fBlnet\fR; just make sure you set up your interface correctly as needed. If you encouter problems after having configured your network with \fBlnet\fR you probably want to adjust the configuration manually.
.PP
The network configuration file for your Lunar installation may be found in \fB/etc/config.d/network/'interface'\fR (f.e. 'eth0' \-> /etc/config.d/network/eth0). Any time you adjust your interface's configuration manually or through \fBlnet\fR you will have to restart the network to make use of any changes that have been done in the meantime. The init script used to start/stop/restart network is \fB/etc/init.d/network\fR.
.PP
Example: \fB/etc/init.d/network restart\fR
.PP
Good luck and please remember that you \fBhave to\fR to be able to ping f.e. 'google.com' to install any other packages or update your system!
.SH "CORE UPDATES AND SETUP"
.IX Header "CORE UPDATES AND SETUP"
Since Lunar Linux is a source based distribution, some of the binaries and/or modules on the \s-1CD\s0 may have been upgraded to newer versions already. Here are the first steps you should take to get an up\-to\-date, smoothly running and fast system:
.Sh "Update your coretools"
.IX Subsection "Update your coretools"
You need to get the most recent version of the available \fBcoretools\fR. The \fBcoretools\fR are the heart of every \fBLunar Linux\fR system. They provide you with all the necessary commands to maintain a working installation thus it's always recommended to have the latest version installed. There are two different choices:
.PP
\&\fBlunar\fR or \fBtheedge\fR
.PP
\&\fBlunar\fR is the stable branch of the lunar \fBcoretools\fR. It's ment to run with  stable production environments. \fBtheedge\fR is the unstable branch. It might occasionally contain bugs, however it's generally used to test out new features and bugfixes before they're migrated to the stable branch. If you'd like to help out with the lunar development or you discovered a bug in \fBlunar\fR you might want to give \fBtheedge\fR a try.
.PP
Since the \s-1ISO\s0 ships with \fBtheedge\fR preinstalled you \fBhave to\fR update \fBtheedge\fR before you do anything else .. even if you're planning to use \fBlunar\fR lateron!
.PP
Execute: \fBlin theedge\fR
.PP
If you want to keep \fBLunar Linux\fR as stable as possible you need to install the stable \fBcoretools\fR branch now by running
.PP
Execute: \fBlin lunar\fR
.Sh "Core Components"
.IX Subsection "Core Components"
A very brief explaination of the most important coretool components. For further information regarding the referenced parts please refer to their manpages (i.e. man <part>):
.IP "\fBlin\fR; usage: lin <module>" 4
.IX Item "lin; usage: lin <module>"
Install a package/module.
.IP "\fBlvu\fR; usage: lvu <options> <module>" 4
.IX Item "lvu; usage: lvu <options> <module>"
Gather information about a package/module.
.IP "\fBlrm\fR; usage: lrm <module>" 4
.IX Item "lrm; usage: lrm <module>"
Remove a package/module.
.IP "\fBlunar\fR; usage: lunar <options>" 4
.IX Item "lunar; usage: lunar <options>"
Lunar configuration utility
.Sh "Update your moonbase"
.IX Subsection "Update your moonbase"
The package repository from where the \fBcoretools\fR gather their \fBpackage information\fR is called \fBmoonbase\fR. Also, packages are usually referred to as \fBmodules\fR. Since the moonbase on your installation is probably outdated it's strongly recommended to update your moonbase right after your coretools.
.PP
Execute: \fBlin moonbase\fR
.Sh "Set your preferences"
.IX Subsection "Set your preferences"
\&\fBLunar Linux\fR can easily be customized and is highly configurable. For changing the options that affect your system you may use the menu driven \fBlunar\fR configuration utility. It's based upon ncurses which means you can even run it in the console of your choice. You need to become root to use it.
.IP "\fBOptimizations\fR" 4
.IX Item "Optimizations"
Set the right optimizations for your computer. Beware that changing your optimizations to the wrongly values might actually break your whole installations so be really carefull about what you're chosing. The \s-1ISO\s0 has been built with a minimum of available optimizations to ensure the highest amount of flexibility. To see wether or not your processor supports a certain feature try a \fBcat /proc/cpu\fR. It usually shows the available settings that suit your machine.
.IP "\fBIntegrity checking\fR" 4
.IX Item "Integrity checking"
Lunar is performing a range of security checks on tarballs and installed packages to prevent faulty tarballs and possible intruders from taking over your system. It also ensures that none of your currently installed packages is broken.
.Sp
You may select the amount of checks from the \fBIntegrity checking\fR submenu at the \fBOptions\fR menu. It's generally recommeneded to at least chose \fB\s-1FIND_CHECK\s0\fR and \fB\s-1LDD_CHECK\s0\fR.
.IP "\fBFeature menu\fR" 4
.IX Item "Feature menu"
As mentioned before, Lunar is highly configurable. Thus you have a whole menu to select its features from. It's strongly advised to at least take a look at it and get used to them. Explanations are usually displayed as soon as you select an item.
.IP "\fBApart from that\fR" 4
.IX Item "Apart from that"
Take a look at the \fBlunar\fR configuration tool. It can be a \fBpowerful companion\fR while achieving the goal of setting up your system.
.SH "GENERAL UPDATES"
.IX Header "GENERAL UPDATES"
Right now you're set to update your whole system. Before you do that make sure you have the most recent \fBcoretools\fR and \fBmoonbase\fR installed.
.PP
The next step can be omitted .. however, it is highly recommened that you rebuild the following modules in the right order to ensure that your system is working right.
.PP
Here we go:
.PP
Execute: \fBlin \-cr gcc glibc gcc bash coreutils tar wget\fR
.PP
\&\fBExplanation:\fR
.PP
\&\fBlin\fR is obviously used to install a module. It also accepts multiple modules in a row. The '\-cr' switch means 'compile (c)' and 'reconfigure (r)'. They're explained at the manpage. One needs to update gcc thus the first gcc statement. Right after that one should recompile glibc to ensure that it's working well with the latest compiled gcc. And finally gcc again to make use of the newly compiled glibc. The modules right afterwards are used by \fBLunar Linux\fR itself thus they need to be up-to-date and compiled against the latest available gcc and glibc.
.Sh "\fBA complete update\fP"
.IX Subsection "A complete update"
Now, to update your whole system you need to issue the following
.PP
Execute: \fBlunar update\fR
.PP
It's going to compare your system's installed modules against the moonbases' definitions and update the installed modules accordingly. It's going to give you a list of modules that are going to be updated. If you're not sure wether you want a certain module to be updated remove it from the list. Once you're done the coretools are going to start the update which usually is going to take a very long time on a freshly installed system since most of its components will probably be outdated. So grab a coffee and/or a book and wait for it to finish ;\-)
.PP
Once it is done it is going to present you with a summary about how many module where successfully updated and which of them failed. \fBlvu\fR ('lvu activity') is going to show you which of them failed and usually why. \fBlvu\fR ('lvu compile <module>') is also going to show you the compilation's logfile which should clearly point you to the error that led to the failure of the module's compilation.
.PP
The first thing to do would be to 're'lin' (i.e. execute \fBlin \-c\fR once more. It is always advised to use the \-c and the \-r switch incase a module fails to compile) all the failed modules by hand. If you think you will not be able to resolve the matter on your own you can still file a bugreport at the \fBLunar Linux bugtracker\fR http://bugs.lunar\-linux.org or report the error to the \fBLunar Linux mailinglist\fR. However, you will have to subscribe to the list at http://foo\-projects.org/mailman/listinfo/lunar before being able to post any mail to it.
.PP
Once the update has been completed successfully you may go ahead and customize your installation to suit your own needs. Well done!
.SH "HINTS"
.IX Header "HINTS"
.IP "\fBTAB-completion\fR" 4
.IX Item "TAB-completion"
All of the coretools are able to do tab\-completion. Say, you want to install the module 'xfce4\-panel' just go ahead and type 'lin xfce4\-p<\s-1TAB\s0>' and lin is going to append the rest of the module's name to the command. Once there are too few characters to resolve the name into one single module you just need to hit \s-1TAB\s0 twice to get a list of all the modules starting with the characters you just typed i.e. 'lin xfce<\s-1TAB\s0><\s-1TAB\s0>' is going to give you a list of all modules starting with 'xfce'.
.IP "\fB\s-1IRC\s0 channel\fR" 4
.IX Item "IRC channel"
The fastest help you get is by chatting with the developers directly. Join the \fBLunar Linux \s-1IRC\s0 channel\fR at freenode
