	* sbin/lin: Cleaning up here: we don't really need that message since blacklist.x86 is EMPTY.

	* var/state/lunar/: blacklist.x86, gcc.x86: Merging theedge in here too: gcc.x86 is obsolete for 4 months already, tossing it out. Also AFAIK most module in there compile anyway.

	* sbin/lget: Okay, here's the problem: you implement downloading with locking, so lin
	can call lget without worrying wether it is already downloading or now,
	now you add another download option, but you forget to add locking to that
	feature. As you can guess, when you try to install AND lin forces a download
	through that other feature, it will start to download it, and then probe
	for it again just before pre_build, because lin calls lget twice somehow. Not
	at all a problem, unless you forget to add the locking mechanism to the other
	feature, right? (short: implemented locking where it is needed, should fix
	download/lin problems of CVS modules)
