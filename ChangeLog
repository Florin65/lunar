	* etc/lunar/config: Adding the X11 path to the static lunar PATH

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/kernel.lunar: * get rid of the annoying
	  grub install questions (adding a warning that it should be
	  installed).  * add a white line between kernel entries.

	* etc/lunar/config: We should use a hardcoded PATH, no user
	  components allowed by default! This also solves /sbin/ldconfig
	  not being accessible on some systems etc. Note user can still
	  override PATH with `lunar set PATH xxxxx`, but it's not exported
	  to sub-apps.
