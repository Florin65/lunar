2003-02-16 20:06  csm

	* usr/share/doc/lunar/core-documentation/: etc_lunar_config.html,
	purpose.html: beginning to add core-docs

2003-02-16 13:27  sofar

	* sbin/lin, var/lib/lunar/subroutines,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/postbuild.lunar: More cleanups, splitting
	out all postbuild extensions (xinetd, init.d, pamd etc). Bugfix
	#248.

2003-02-15 23:47  sofar

	* sbin/lunar: Fix for #221

2003-02-15 23:17  sofar

	* sbin/lin, var/lib/lunar/subroutines: verbose pruning and boost
	problems GONE FOREVER

2003-02-15 22:38  sofar

	* sbin/lin: wheps

2003-02-15 21:59  sofar

	* sbin/lsh: Adding this little gadget: lsh, a 'shell' wrapper
	around the lunar.

2003-02-15 20:51  sofar

	* sbin/lget: CVS fixed that were needed. let's not spend too much
	time here.

2003-02-15 20:09  sofar

	* sbin/lin, sbin/lrm, var/lib/lunar/subroutines,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Fix for (1) tar error on
	cache, removed --verbose from lrm, cleaned up more code, unified
	verbose messages.
	
	Also, the remove_module which people assumed to be removed
	incedentally was removed again, since the call is made by lrm
	(l228,l296). PLEASE LEAVE IT OUT NOW, since doing this belongs in
	the lrm code.

2003-02-14 15:52  tchan

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Added back in the "missing" call to
	remove_modules.  I believe it is still required and was removed by
	sofar accidentally in his clean up.

2003-02-14 00:06  sofar

	* sbin/lin, sbin/lunar, var/lib/lunar/excluded,
	var/lib/lunar/subroutines, var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar:
	Major code update, including VERBOSE flag (default off, cos lin is
	still noisy), lots and lots of core rewrites, optimizations,
	formatting and spacing, removal of old and unused code, etc.

2003-02-13 12:25  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: more more cleanups

2003-02-13 12:13  sofar

	* sbin/lin: more cleanups

2003-02-13 12:09  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: More code cleanups.

2003-02-13 12:01  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Code cleanups and
	speedups.

2003-02-08 02:30  csm

	* etc/lunar/config: changing the last resort URL to .org instead of
	.com

2003-02-06 10:08  sofar

	* sbin/lrm: heh, got scared?

2003-02-06 00:00  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Adding --keepconfig in here to get
	lunar renew working again, see lrm commit.

2003-02-05 23:53  sofar

	* sbin/lin: adding --keepconfig so config files stay untouched.

2003-02-05 23:52  sofar

	* sbin/lrm: First couple of fixes:
	
	* no bailout when no DETAILS found (lrm should be possible afterall
	the install log is there) * add --keepconfig in order
	prepare_install functions normally * missing md5sum should PRESERVE
	config files just in case, as we know lunar already makes good
	md5sums, and in case that feature is off bad things go happen *
	updated help.
	
	TODO:
	
	- add regex support for excluded/protected like /etc/.*\.conf -
	speed profile removal queue processing: it is *SLOW*, consider
	reimporting old lrm routine which constructs a large grep statement
	(hazardous: command line chars are expensive and bash can only
	handle so much) - test

2003-02-05 14:17  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/excluded: and more

2003-02-05 13:23  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/excluded: Adding some more in here

2003-02-04 00:59  csm

	* var/lib/lunar/excluded: some more additions

2003-02-03 22:18  csm

	* var/lib/lunar/excluded: adding critical postfix files

2003-02-03 14:29  elaine

	* lib/lsb/init-functions: Added 'mk_spid()' function, to be used on
	starting a daemon and modified 'mk_pid()' and 'pidok()' functions
	to prevent lunar from wiping out the /var/run/*.pid files of
	daemons which create these files on thier own.	This allows sshd to
	be restarted remotely, killing only the server process.

2003-02-02 00:08  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/menu/optimize.menu: More info for the meek

2003-02-01 23:31  sofar

	* sbin/: lrm, lrm2: Lrm2 will replace lrm forever into eternity!

2003-02-01 19:33  csm

	* usr/share/man/man8/lfirsttime.8: a few updates and cleanups

2003-02-01 16:27  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: I thought I added this
	already

2003-02-01 16:26  sofar

	* sbin/lin: Cleaning up here: we don't really need that message
	since blacklist.x86 is EMPTY.

2003-02-01 14:55  sofar

	* sbin/lget: Okay, here's the problem: you implement downloading
	with locking, so lin can call lget without worrying wether it is
	already downloading or now, now you add another download option,
	but you forget to add locking to that feature. As you can guess,
	when you try to install AND lin forces a download through that
	other feature, it will start to download it, and then probe for it
	again just before pre_build, because lin calls lget twice somehow.
	Not at all a problem, unless you forget to add the locking
	mechanism to the other feature, right? (short: implemented locking
	where it is needed, should fix download/lin problems of CVS
	modules)

2003-02-01 05:18  wizfactor

	* sbin/lin: Finished updating xinet (bug 232)

2003-02-01 01:08  wizfactor

	* sbin/lin: Fixed bug in the xinet.d services install. Should fix
	bug 232.

2003-01-30 05:22  tchan

	* usr/share/man/man8/lfirsttime.8: Fixed some punctuation.

2003-01-30 05:17  tchan

	* usr/share/man/man8/lfirsttime.8: Updated lfirsttime with some
	more fixes.

2003-01-29 20:26  sofar

	* sbin/lunar: Fix for that nasty one bug.

2003-01-29 19:34  tchan

	* usr/share/man/man8/lfirsttime.8: Updated the URL's and added a
	bit more info.

2003-01-29 12:27  sofar

	* bin/lvu, sbin/lin, sbin/lrm, sbin/lunar, usr/sbin/colony,
	var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Generalizing code: less is now replaced
	with view_file(), which also handles stdin of course. It also will
	use the $PAGER env variable for those who want to override it with
	their default pager. Small effort, big gain.

2003-01-29 10:28  sofar

	* bin/lvu, usr/share/man/man1/lvu.1: Adding functionality to view
	the logfile easier: 'lvu activity'

2003-01-25 23:17  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Nice going ;^)

2003-01-25 22:01  sofar

2003-01-25 22:00  sofar

2003-01-25 21:59  sofar

	* sbin/lget: CVS dir fixes.

2003-01-24 21:12  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: more trapdoors removed from cvs
	handling code.

2003-01-24 21:00  sofar

	* sbin/lget: Last modifications to cvs/lget - better source tree
	management, trapdoors removed.

2003-01-21 11:53  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Code change: sedit now handles
	multiple files in one sedit statement, and in place backups are no
	longer made.

2003-01-20 15:23  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/sustained: Sorry for the gpm fans, but gpm is *NOT*
	a vital package for the correct functioning of lunar. Removing it
	here.

2003-01-19 23:14  sofar

	* etc/lunar/mirrors/LRESORT: Popping in DNS names!
