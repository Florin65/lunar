	* var/lib/lunar/functions/build.lunar: meh... suck

2005-01-19 12:09  moe

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/view.lunar: There's also the type 'data'

2005-01-19 11:37  sofar

	* bin/lvu: indeed I missed it

2005-01-19 11:32  sofar

	* bin/lvu: removed bolding of modules

2005-01-12 17:17  striker

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: adding opts for amd64's
	  (note that this can only be used by manually changing
	  /etc/lunar/local/optimizations )

2005-01-11 21:52  striker

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: Fix for possible wget
	  exploit

2004-12-19 12:10  sofar

	* sbin/lrm: Adding quotes fixes #634

2004-12-14 15:38  sofar

	* sbin/lrm: I just forgot to add the option to getopt()... meh

2004-12-14 15:31  sofar

	* sbin/lrm: I'm losing it here

2004-12-14 15:25  sofar

	* sbin/lrm: More typo's

2004-12-14 15:21  sofar

	* sbin/lrm: needed... logic

2004-12-14 15:05  sofar

	* etc/lunar/config, sbin/lrm, usr/share/man/man8/lrm.8,
	  var/lib/lunar/functions/build.lunar,
	  var/lib/lunar/functions/main.lunar,
	  var/lib/lunar/functions/sources.lunar,
	  var/lib/lunar/functions/tracking.lunar: deleting BOOST_LOCK from
	  existance. Also adding lrm --upgrade to explicitly NOT run
	  PRE_|POST_remove scripts since this causes deadlocks. lrm man
	  page adjusted

2004-12-14 06:11  tchan

	* etc/lunar/config: Removing the .se mirror as requested by bkw.

2004-12-13 15:43  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/locking.lunar: color fixes

2004-12-12 22:56  moe

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: This will buy us some
	  more time just incase the user is sitting behind a _really huge_
	  pipe.

	* sbin/lin: bugfix: if lin_module ends up calling a recompile of
	  another modules it may not leave SINGLE_MODULE=1. This would
	  circumvent all dependency checking etc. and never call the dl
	  manager on those modules either.

2004-12-10 10:56  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: Bugfix for the theedge dl
	  problems: when we get to this code and a post-install triggered a
	  recompile the _PID is never stored so it's empty... we can
	  gracefully exit and ignore this usually. I added a fallback
	  function when the module is locked so at least st is going on. I
	  hope this calls all exceptions.

2004-12-10 10:46  sofar

	* bin/lvu, etc/lunar/config, sbin/lget,
	  var/lib/lunar/functions/build.lunar,
	  var/lib/lunar/functions/connect.lunar,
	  var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar,
	  var/lib/lunar/functions/messages.lunar,
	  var/lib/lunar/functions/moonbase.lunar,
	  var/lib/lunar/functions/queue.lunar,
	  var/lib/lunar/functions/temp.lunar: define TMPDIR and use it
	  globally. Its position is overwriteable by using lunar set TMPDIR

2004-12-08 08:35  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/build.lunar: Better check: this literally
	  looks how larege the installwatch file is. If it's zero then the
	  module has not installed ANY file and thus the warning is legit.
	  Most likely profile modules now only are a problem but we'll cope
	  with them a different way.

2004-12-07 14:11  moe

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: We all love eye candy.
	  This now is _almost_ as fast as the real output ;-)

2004-12-07 13:56  sofar

	* sbin/lin: foo

2004-12-07 12:12  sofar

	* sbin/lin, var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: Implemented
	  Moe's download idea: separate lget processes and logs for each
	  downloaded file. The dl manager passes the PID on later and
	  before a module is compiled ONLY that relevant download info is
	  displayed.
