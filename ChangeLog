	systems

	one

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/postbuild.lunar: Same permissions but
	changed code so it's actually not rediculous

2004-05-26 11:28  prox

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: correction

2004-05-26 09:33  prox

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: added is_depended <module>
	<depend>, will return 1 if the depend for the module given is on

	* bin/lvu: Proper directory handling that allows both passing
	absolute and relative filenames of the snapshot.

2004-05-24 13:12  sofar

	* bin/lvu: Fixing export/import scripts. It now includes a copy of
	'packages' and sorts the queue according to dependency as well,
	which should make things easier (note some things still don't work
	that way correctly).

2004-05-21 19:51  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/moonbase.lunar: make 'moonbase'
	'hold'-able =^D (nice for those rebuilds)

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: Bad is when this file is
	missing and it never gets created...

2004-05-10 15:31  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/check.lunar: This is a fix for 'lunar
	fix' looping on clean installs: <sofar|work> yeah I did some chroot
	crunching ;^) <sofar|work> on a clean ISO <sofar|work> there's
	md5sum mismatches in glibc's libxxx.a files that trigger it
	<sofar|work> then ENV var pollution makes the wrong files
	rebuild... you get the rest

2004-05-10 11:46  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/recovery.lunar: This way recovery even
	recovers the approximate install date. I've tested this on many
	boxes now and it's absolutely wonderfull. Considering putting this
	in the lunar maintenance menu so people can use it (although it's
	still mopping up after some other part goofs up)

2004-05-09 12:08  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/: depends.lunar, main.lunar,
	messages.lunar, modules.lunar, prune.lunar, recovery.lunar: Some
	bugfixes regarding locking, ordering of locks and return status of
	locking, some fixes with missing depends (important one), visual
	adjustment of titlebar display (compile instead of processing,
	added hostname, $0[$$]).
