	bkup assuming in all places to use convention
	<kernel-version>-<module-identifier> where this string should match
	the version-extraversion id in the kernl Makefile

2003-10-06 02:08  elaine

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/kernel.lunar: Added installwatch
	frobbing, hacked and added grub and lilo stanza makers (w/

2003-10-01 16:28  elaine

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/: check.lunar, edit.lunar, install.lunar,
	modules.lunar, sizes.lunar, temp.lunar, tracking.lunar:
	install.lunar: fixed failure to correctly remove depends/module
	file rename mv_edit() routine mod_v_safe_edit()

2003-09-24 12:13  nhudson

	* var/lib/lunar/excluded: 
	Adding /etc/bonobo-activation and its file to excluded because it
	gets deleted when you remove evolution which is a very bad! thing!

2003-09-19 21:32  sofar

	* etc/lunar/mirrors/GNOME: 
	Updating Gnome mirror locations

2003-09-14 23:16  nhudson

	* var/lib/lunar/excluded: 
	Adding /etc/xml/docbook /etc/xml/catalog and /etc/sgml/catalog to

	scrollkeeper or libglade2

2003-09-12 02:11  elaine

	* usr/share/man/man8/lin.8: Added clarification to manual page -V
	version names must begin with [0-9]

2003-09-12 00:33  niki

	* sbin/lunar, var/lib/lunar/functions/main.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/menu/integrity.menu: Moved the rest of the
	depreciated "lin --fix" over to "lunar fix".

2003-09-11 16:03  tchan

	* sbin/lin: Corrected a spelling mistake.

2003-09-11 05:09  elaine

	* bin/lvu, sbin/lin, usr/share/man/man8/lin.8,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/check.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/edit.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/install.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/locking.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/sizes.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/temp.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/tracking.lunar: Initial versioning support
	for lunar, where versions are either version-aware modules or
	subdirectories of the primary module.

2003-08-31 18:51  sofar

	* etc/lunar/config, etc/lunar/mirrors/LRESORT,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: Adding nl.lunar-linux.org
	to the mirror URL's, since it's rsynced hourly and can be used
	normally like the dk mirror. Also adding it to LRESORT as so we can
	drop the number of downloads from dbguin. Small fix for calls to
	LRESORT downloads, and starting to rephrase numeric statements to
	something that is unmistakenly numeric (( ... )).

2003-08-19 20:06  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/excluded: Adding /root/.distcc and resorting it
	alphabetically.

2003-08-16 19:54  elaine

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/postbuild.lunar: $IFS setting was causing
	variables to be improperly set for 'grep'

2003-08-16 17:04  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/compilers/: c++, cc, g++, gcc: Needed cos some
	developers insist on passing spaces around within #defines.

2003-08-14 21:27  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/: build.lunar, postbuild.lunar: yeah I
	know... looks like nothing... somehow this fixes all those init.d
	scripts hanging since a tee traces the fork to the daemon and waits
	before it exits... this should fix all 3 bugs on
	bugs.lunar-linux.org related to init.d scripts (I hope)

2003-08-14 20:25  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/install.lunar: re-enabling reports for
	succesfull resurrects, perhaps this needs a more elaborate rewrite,
	but it works for now. broken resurrects are not reported (as tchan
	says they werent in the past anyways).

2003-08-14 19:57  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/check.lunar: Disabling recompiles after
	"lunar fixdepends"

2003-08-14 19:41  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/: compilers/c++, compilers/cc, compilers/g++,
	compilers/gcc, functions/download.lunar, functions/optimize.lunar:
	this one fixes the appearing '1' file and also re-enables distcc
	(MAKES wasn't being set correctly due to this bug.) I'm also
	enabling DEBUG output in the wrapper scripts so you can see -pipe
	DOES WORK, you just don't see it ;^).
