2004-02-13 17:17  sofar

	* etc/lunar/: config, mirrors/LRESORT: Adding the 2 new mirrors in
	the URL list, please use them!

	* usr/share/doc/lunar/CREDITS: Removing sofar's last commit as bkw
	was already in the list.  He was added after his ibackup module was
	committed to moonbase.	The CREDITS list is trying to be
	alphabetical by "nickname".

2004-02-03 23:12  sofar

	* usr/share/doc/lunar/CREDITS: Before I forget... thanks!

2004-02-03 18:41  cmak

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/prune.lunar: fixed bug 439

2004-01-21 16:56  tchan

	* usr/share/doc/lunar/CREDITS: Fixed another typo.  Added Erik
	Sorenson to the file for his depends code contribution.

2004-01-21 16:32  hardkrash

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: making algorithim
	improvments proposed by Erik Søe Sørensen
	
	thankyou sir

2004-01-14 20:42  tchan

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Fixing the dialog box for
	MAKES=.  The old message was just too confusing for most people.

2004-01-12 06:51  hardkrash

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/config.lunar: Beginings for new CONFIGURE
	file scheme that allows for formats and options to change
	
	new system will set a date in the $MODULE_CONFIG file in the
	CONFIGURED variable with the set_module_configured function
	
	and the get_module configuted function checks if the configuration
	date is newer than the stored one
	
	this i believe is a better way than we have now and it prevents yet
	another variable in DETAILS files
	
	as this coide would only be called by modules that use the new
	scheme

2004-01-11 22:33  hardkrash

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/build.lunar: This is the fix to bug 432. 
	Where the make alias isn't being used while linning.  This also
	will fix open mosix builds too. 
	http://bugs.lunar-linux.org/view_bug_page.php?f_id=0000432

2004-01-11 22:25  hardkrash

	* sbin/lin: first of 2 parts to fix make alias in the lunar scripts

2004-01-09 15:38  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: Reverting this back since
	it'll lopp indefinately... BAH, sorry, perhaps someone wants to dig
	into this look, I didn't have enough time to track the problem
	down.

2004-01-09 15:16  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: Falling back to proper
	dependency tracking for sort_by_dependency, this makes it a bit
	slower but should now be a correct solution, which it really
	wasn't.

2004-01-09 14:05  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: Fixing the dependency tree
	sorter bug that caused 'lunar update' to keep showing already
	updated modules and rebuild queue's to miss modules ( I hope ;^) ).
	If needed someone has to tag -F STABLE this to propagate this to
	lunar.

2004-01-07 05:22  watryac04

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/kernel.lunar: Added stub for
	update_aboot.  Keeps the POST_INSTALL on alphas from failing.  Will
	complete the function ASAP.  Added this now after tchan's
	prompting.

2004-01-05 05:13  tchan

	* usr/share/doc/lunar/CREDITS: Corrected r0dzilla's real name.

2004-01-05 05:00  tchan

	info from Florin.

2004-01-04 17:40  tchan

	* usr/share/doc/lunar/CREDITS: Fixed for some obvious omissions. 
	Corrected some email addresses.  Sorted the list by IRC nickname
	and noted that fact at the top of the list.

2004-01-04 13:57  sofar

	* usr/share/doc/lunar/CREDITS: Adding some historical information,
	and readable text around the contributors. I'm considering adding
	an 'active developer' section too, ideas? Feel free to add/edit.

2004-01-04 09:32  cmak

	* usr/share/doc/lunar/CREDITS: changed mine BEEP to a much nicer
	BEEP

2004-01-04 00:40  cmak

	* usr/share/doc/lunar/CREDITS: new CREDITS file .)

2004-01-03 23:34  tchan

	* usr/share/doc/lunar/contributions/: auke, bkw, csm, nick, terry:
	Updated a few contributers files here.	BKW requested to be added
	to the list.  We really need to update this section of the doc
	sometime!  :-)

2004-01-02 00:39  sofar

	* bin/lvu: Reworked the following routines:
	
	tree: now soupah fast stree: even faster and abbreviated eert: does
	what it did, but faster (installed mods only) leert: shows the
	entire reverse tree (not installed modules too!) orphans: meuh
	cleanup help: added hints to new functions

2003-12-30 13:11  sofar

	* bin/lvu: Added 'lvu short' just because I like it

2003-12-29 18:09  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/: build.lunar, check.lunar,
	depends.lunar, download.lunar, edit.lunar, install.lunar,
	kernel.lunar, locking.lunar, logging.lunar, main.lunar,
	messages.lunar, modules.lunar, prune.lunar, queue.lunar,
	sources.lunar: Major code cleanup: - cosmetic modifications - new
	prune code (the old one sucked ass) - new dependency sort (about
	20x faster) - rewrote rebuild code (should be much more reliable) -
	Reordered code into it's proper .lunar files, got rid of
	install.lunar

2003-12-28 17:46  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/install.lunar: Call lrm when doing an
	explicit resurrect! (overwriting is not bad per se, but this is
	more decent)

2003-12-28 14:35  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/: build.lunar, connect.lunar,
	install.lunar, sources.lunar: Cleanups and some slight adjustments
	towards CPAN code, md5sum checkings.

2003-12-22 18:33  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/check.lunar: minor adjustment to make it
	more resistant against my imagination.

2003-12-22 18:21  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/check.lunar: Fixing lunar "fixdepends"
	code, much more slick now... will need to be tested before merging
	down to lunar though.

2003-12-22 17:31  sofar

	* bin/lvu: Fixed up lvu voyeur... it works now again!!! (note it's
	a bit crude but quite effective at finding the right compile log
	file, it should work for everyone)
