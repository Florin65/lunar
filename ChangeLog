	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: more trapdoors removed from cvs
	handling code.

2003-01-24 21:00  sofar

	* sbin/lget: Last modifications to cvs/lget - better source tree
	management, trapdoors removed.

2003-01-21 11:53  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Code change: sedit now handles
	multiple files in one sedit statement, and in place backups are no
	longer made.

2003-01-20 15:23  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/sustained: Sorry for the gpm fans, but gpm is *NOT*
	a vital package for the correct functioning of lunar. Removing it
	here.

2003-01-19 23:14  sofar

	* etc/lunar/mirrors/LRESORT: Popping in DNS names!

2003-01-17 14:22  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Bugfix: fix for missing
	'ChangeLog' module when running lget without a module name. Rewrote
	all fcuntions to use base functions instead of rewriting
	list_sections 4 times. Code cleanups. Added ChangeLog to ignore
	list in list_modules and list_sections.

2003-01-17 14:04  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Simplified sedit.

2003-01-05 20:31  sofar

	* etc/lunar/config: New default LRESORT URL.

2003-01-05 20:29  sofar

	* etc/lunar/mirrors/LRESORT: Putting new source caches in here.

2003-01-02 22:27  sofar

	* sbin/lget: Fix for broken cvs update being stored in
	$SOURCE_CACHE, beautified, removed unset CVS_RSH.

2003-01-02 16:18  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Adding support to handle TARred patch
	sets!

2003-01-02 14:32  sofar

	* sbin/lunar: Adding "Maintenance" menu that allows you to run lin
	--fix, --nofix, --fixdepends from the menu system.

2003-01-01 23:24  sofar

	* sbin/lin: Removing autopatch scheme

2003-01-01 22:46  sofar

	* sbin/lget, var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Adding code to store
	CVS-sources after 'co' or 'up' into SOURCE_CACHE, so that the
	source code is always clean when lin runs, and we still have the
	possibility of doing incremental updates. Also added a small visual
	message in sedit () to verbosely show that files are edited.

2003-01-01 21:31  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/updatelog.lunar: This should fix the
	weird messages after a lunar update/renew

2002-12-30 22:24  hardkrash

	* sbin/lget: added ability to use tun devices for internet
	connection -- Hardkrash

2002-12-29 23:42  sofar

	* etc/lunar/config: Added PATCH_URL to config, the new repository
	for patches.

2002-12-24 18:19  tchan

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/updatelog.lunar: Synched a change from
	lunar version of updatelog.lunar back into theedge.

2002-12-24 18:00  xoritor

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Fixed MAKES and PSAFE
	issues.

2002-12-23 01:10  sofar

	* sbin/lin: okay this works now without CVS bullocking it.

2002-12-23 01:07  sofar

	* sbin/lin: leave out the * to omit subdirs in case of CVS.

2002-12-23 01:00  sofar

	* usr/share/doc/lunar/module-example/patch/example.patch: Adding
	some descriptive text.

2002-12-23 00:49  sofar

	* sbin/lin: Added auto-patching: scan for subdir 'patch' and apply
	all regular files in that directory before BUILD/default_build.
	Note patch order is equal to 'ls'.

2002-12-22 17:40  tchan

	* sbin/lunar: Fixed the help message for KEEP_SOURCE to make sure
	its clear why you would turn this flag on.

2002-12-22 17:04  tchan

	* sbin/lunar: Better explanation of the KEEP_SOURCE option in Lunar
	help message.  KEEP_SOURCE toggles the default behavior in Lunar
	core tools of removing /usr/src/module code after a SUCCESSFUL
	compile.  Default behavior has always been to remove the module
	source after a succesful compile and KEEP the source after a failed
	compile.  Xoritor added the KEEP_SOURCE flag for developers using
	the gcc profiling tools as the tools need access to the source code
	even after a good compile.  This option is not to be used for
	removing source code after a failed compile.  Someone else can add
	another flag for always removing source code but that will probably
	break this option flag for the developers using the profiling code.

2002-12-22 07:02  tchan

	* sbin/lin: Reverted the lin code to the old behavior of NOT
	deleting source code when a compile fails.  It IS necessary to keep
	source code around for failed compiles as the compile log does NOT
	contain all the necessary information to fix a failed compile --
	especially when debugging failed GNU autotools type problems. 
	Having to run Lunar menu to turn on the keep source option and then
	recompile a failed module is a BIG waste of time.  Please leave
	this behavior alone!  Keep failed source code around.

2002-12-21 22:49  sofar

	* sbin/lin: Default compile fail will remove the sources from
	/usr/src. Since logging of compiles and activity is now in order,
	this is no longer needed, and prevent a big mess from happening in
	case your lunar rebuild goes booboo.

2002-12-16 10:48  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/compilers/: c++, cc, g++, gcc: Better wrappers: sed
	off wrapper path to make ccache work again.

2002-12-11 21:39  xoritor

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Fixed KEEP_SOURCE bug.

2002-12-09 21:24  xoritor

	* sbin/lget: Adding quiet opton to cvs update and checkout, now
	only important messages will be printed.
	
	Fixed CVS_LOGIN to behave better.

2002-12-09 10:20  sofar

	* sbin/lget: Adding download failure logging including URLS

2002-12-08 19:16  xoritor

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Fixed installed_version when checking
	version of "installed linux".

2002-12-08 18:34  xoritor

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Added 2 keywords for bad_flags,
	compiler and linker.
	
	  bad_flags compiler unsets all compiler flags set by CFLAGS,
	CXXFLAGS, and CPPFLAGS.
	
	  bad_flags linker unsets all linker flags set by LDFLAGS.

2002-12-08 18:04  xoritor

	* var/lib/lunar/: subroutines, functions/optimize.lunar: Added 2
	new subroutines (bad_flags and patch_it):
	
	  bad_flags is a subroutine to remove any known bad flags on a per
	module basis, this effects system CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, and CPPFLAGS as
	well as optimizations chosen in lunar.	It is to be used as
	follows:
	
	    bad_flags <list of bad CFLAGS and LDFLAGS>
	
	      Example:
	      bad_flags -ffast-math -funroll-loops -s
	
	    Or to remove ALL optimizations use:
	      bad_flags ALL (Case matters!)
	
	  patch_it is a subroutine to create a generic patching interface
	for lunar modules it is to be used as follows:
	
	    patch_it <patch location/patch name> <patch level>
	
	      Example:
		patch_it $SOURCE_CACHE/4.2.0-4.2.1.diff.gz 1
	
	Added more support for KEEP_SOURCE options into default_prebuild.

2002-12-08 00:52  tchan

	* sbin/: lin, lunar: Hacked in $KEEP_SOURCE into lunar menu and
	fixed lin to use $KEEP_SOURCE.	This allows sysadmin to tell "lin"
	to keep the source code in /usr/src and as opposed to the default
	behavior of removing source code on successful builds.

2002-12-07 20:47  xoritor

	* var/lib/lunar/: functions/optimize.lunar, menu/optimize.menu:
	Updating optimizations:   Added C warnings options:    
	-Wno-deprecated
	
	  Added C++ warnings options:
	    -Wno-deprecated
	
	  Added Speed options:
	    -fexpensive-optimizations
	    -falign-double
	
	  Added framework for Stack optimization/manipulation, this can be
	different for each platform. Currently only the x86 is supported
	(-mpreferred-stack-boundary) but should allow others to be added
	easily.

2002-12-04 13:30  sofar

	* bin/lvu: Fix for the '/levels-list: no such file...' bug.
	(SCRIPT_DIRECTORY undeclared)

2002-12-04 08:42  tchan

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Added to the activity_log function a
	timestamp as part of the datestamp.

2002-11-28 16:05  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Fix #189

2002-11-28 15:41  sofar

	* sbin/lin: Fix for doubly reporting a failed compile, once as
	failed, once as success.

2002-11-26 14:56  kc8apf

	* lib/lsb/init-functions: Fix documented in Lunar

2002-11-21 05:20  hardkrash

	* var/lib/lunar/menu/optimize.menu: Added PPC and Power options to
	lunar menu and corrected menu info for optizations

2002-11-21 05:18  hardkrash

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Added PPC and power
	options to lunar optimizations

2002-11-15 05:37  dem

	* var/state/lunar/blacklist.x86: gstreamer is now stable and
	rhythmbox box acctualy works now

2002-11-08 04:17  xoritor

	* sbin/lin: Fixed scripting error.
