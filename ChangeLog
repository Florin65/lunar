	* lib/lsb/init-functions: Fix pgrep so it only finds processes that
	start with PROCESS.  It was previously finding any process which
	contained PROCESS, so kapmd was found when apmd was the process
	being searched for.

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/updatelog.lunar: 
	fixed typo MOUDLE caught by Lurch, and added "" to the variables --

	code
