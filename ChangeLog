	* sbin/lget, var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: code cleanups:
	lget!
	
	- moved general functions into functions/download.lunar -
	structured code, no weird function names - molecularized code:
	download_module, get_url, become more atomic functions and less
	vague.	- made lget a dummy frontend, as it should be. lin may
	possibly completely skip lget now and run a download process
	internally.

2003-02-26 22:43  sofar

	* sbin/lrm, var/lib/lunar/subroutines,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Fixing the 'double module'
	bug I've been having and that might have occurred on some systems
	unnoticed. All module functions have been armed against possible
	packages corruption by a crashed lrm (where the packages file
	wasn't updated correctly).

2003-02-25 23:52  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: bugfix #199: remove_depends $MODULE
	will also remove OPTIONAL depends on $MODULE, so lin will prompt
	again if you want to install it or not.

2003-02-25 19:35  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: This is slightly too much IMO

2003-02-25 08:44  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: hmm, this seems more logical.

2003-02-24 22:55  sofar

	* sbin/lget, sbin/lin, sbin/lrm, var/lib/lunar/subroutines,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/edit.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/messages.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/postbuild.lunar: large rewrite of verbose
	messages:
	
	- verbose_msg is now a main function - the function always returns
	true hence fixing the wiped depends problem - migrated all calls to
	new scheme - split up lunar messages functions to messages.lunar -
	split up editing functions to edit.lunar - made lrm slightly less
	verbose

2003-02-24 20:01  kc8apf

	* var/lib/lunar/excluded: Add mailman site config to excluded

2003-02-22 16:11  sofar

	* sbin/lget: verbosity, better separating cvs/non-cvs.

2003-02-22 11:55  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: More verbosity in core functions:
	depends and optional_depends are much more verbose now.

2003-02-21 00:00  sofar

	* sbin/lin, var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Multiple fixes:
	
	* KEEP_SOURCE implemented in rm_source_dir for transparancy *
	verbose error handling of multiple stages within lin (more needed
	but this covers pretty much all cutomizable scripts) * adding
	better logging which shows the failed section. (all devs shout "we
	always wanted that!") * turned my alarm on and went to bed

2003-02-20 21:36  sofar

	* bin/lvu: echo .......... echo

2003-02-20 00:24  sofar

	* sbin/lin, var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Fix #247:
	
	- .iw file was being remove too much (only needed prior to starting
	and after finishing) - compile log was being viewed before it was
	generated.

2003-02-19 23:42  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/updatelog.lunar: Major rewrite: strickter
	var handling, better constricted code. Hope this kills the errors!

2003-02-19 21:19  tchan

	* var/lib/lunar/excluded: Removed /devices.  It is no longer needed
	and should not be on any Lunar boxes anymore.

2003-02-19 20:57  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/sources.lunar: eep! run_details should
	ALWAYS be between ()'s

2003-02-19 20:25  sofar

	* bin/lvu: yeah yeah this is quick.

2003-02-18 15:16  sofar

	* bin/lvu: Sheez what a mess.

2003-02-18 15:08  sofar

	* bin/lvu: Failed compile logs should be displayed if available of
	newer versions instead of older compile logs of installed versions.

2003-02-18 14:28  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/sources.lunar: Fix for lvu prune removing
	CVS sources.

	* etc/lunar/config, sbin/lunar: There, now it's gone :^P

2003-02-16 20:06  csm

	* usr/share/doc/lunar/core-documentation/: etc_lunar_config.html,
	purpose.html: beginning to add core-docs

2003-02-16 13:27  sofar

	* sbin/lin, var/lib/lunar/subroutines,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/postbuild.lunar: More cleanups, splitting
	out all postbuild extensions (xinetd, init.d, pamd etc). Bugfix
	#248.

2003-02-15 23:47  sofar

	* sbin/lunar: Fix for #221

2003-02-15 23:17  sofar

	* sbin/lin, var/lib/lunar/subroutines: verbose pruning and boost
	problems GONE FOREVER

2003-02-15 22:38  sofar

	* sbin/lin: wheps

2003-02-15 21:59  sofar

	* sbin/lsh: Adding this little gadget: lsh, a 'shell' wrapper
	around the lunar.

2003-02-15 20:51  sofar

	* sbin/lget: CVS fixed that were needed. let's not spend too much
	time here.

2003-02-15 20:09  sofar

	* sbin/lin, sbin/lrm, var/lib/lunar/subroutines,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Fix for (1) tar error on
	cache, removed --verbose from lrm, cleaned up more code, unified
	verbose messages.
	
	Also, the remove_module which people assumed to be removed
	incedentally was removed again, since the call is made by lrm
	(l228,l296). PLEASE LEAVE IT OUT NOW, since doing this belongs in
	the lrm code.

2003-02-14 15:52  tchan

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Added back in the "missing" call to
	remove_modules.  I believe it is still required and was removed by
	sofar accidentally in his clean up.

2003-02-14 00:06  sofar

	* sbin/lin, sbin/lunar, var/lib/lunar/excluded,
	var/lib/lunar/subroutines, var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar:
	Major code update, including VERBOSE flag (default off, cos lin is
	still noisy), lots and lots of core rewrites, optimizations,
	formatting and spacing, removal of old and unused code, etc.

2003-02-13 12:25  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: more more cleanups

2003-02-13 12:13  sofar

	* sbin/lin: more cleanups

2003-02-13 12:09  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: More code cleanups.

2003-02-13 12:01  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Code cleanups and
	speedups.

2003-02-08 02:30  csm

	* etc/lunar/config: changing the last resort URL to .org instead of
	.com

2003-02-06 10:08  sofar

	* sbin/lrm: heh, got scared?

2003-02-06 00:00  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Adding --keepconfig in here to get
	lunar renew working again, see lrm commit.

2003-02-05 23:53  sofar

	* sbin/lin: adding --keepconfig so config files stay untouched.

2003-02-05 23:52  sofar

	* sbin/lrm: First couple of fixes:
	
	* no bailout when no DETAILS found (lrm should be possible afterall
	the install log is there) * add --keepconfig in order
	prepare_install functions normally * missing md5sum should PRESERVE
	config files just in case, as we know lunar already makes good
	md5sums, and in case that feature is off bad things go happen *
	updated help.
	
	TODO:
	
	- add regex support for excluded/protected like /etc/.*\.conf -
	speed profile removal queue processing: it is *SLOW*, consider
	reimporting old lrm routine which constructs a large grep statement
	(hazardous: command line chars are expensive and bash can only
	handle so much) - test

2003-02-05 14:17  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/excluded: and more

2003-02-05 13:23  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/excluded: Adding some more in here

2003-02-04 00:59  csm

	* var/lib/lunar/excluded: some more additions

2003-02-03 22:18  csm

	* var/lib/lunar/excluded: adding critical postfix files

2003-02-03 14:29  elaine

	* lib/lsb/init-functions: Added 'mk_spid()' function, to be used on
	starting a daemon and modified 'mk_pid()' and 'pidok()' functions
	to prevent lunar from wiping out the /var/run/*.pid files of
	daemons which create these files on thier own.	This allows sshd to
	be restarted remotely, killing only the server process.

2003-02-02 00:08  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/menu/optimize.menu: More info for the meek

2003-02-01 23:31  sofar

2003-02-01 16:27  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: I thought I added this
	already

2003-02-01 16:26  sofar

	* sbin/lin: Cleaning up here: we don't really need that message
	since blacklist.x86 is EMPTY.

2003-02-01 14:55  sofar

	* sbin/lget: Okay, here's the problem: you implement downloading
	with locking, so lin can call lget without worrying wether it is
	already downloading or now, now you add another download option,
	but you forget to add locking to that feature. As you can guess,
	when you try to install AND lin forces a download through that
	other feature, it will start to download it, and then probe for it
	again just before pre_build, because lin calls lget twice somehow.
	Not at all a problem, unless you forget to add the locking
	mechanism to the other feature, right? (short: implemented locking
	where it is needed, should fix download/lin problems of CVS
	modules)

2003-02-01 05:18  wizfactor

	* sbin/lin: Finished updating xinet (bug 232)

2003-02-01 01:08  wizfactor

	* sbin/lin: Fixed bug in the xinet.d services install. Should fix
	bug 232.

2003-01-30 05:22  tchan

	* usr/share/man/man8/lfirsttime.8: Fixed some punctuation.

2003-01-30 05:17  tchan

	* usr/share/man/man8/lfirsttime.8: Updated lfirsttime with some
	more fixes.
