	  consistent in using base functions, rewrite md5sum_check slightly

	  'lunar fixdepends' to rebuild the depends/depends.backup files if
	  they are nonexistant, and thus empty too!

2005-03-18 10:01  sofar

2005-03-15 11:38  sofar

	  input now causes a repeated question, and the double newline is
	  gone.

2005-03-15 10:36  sofar

	  consistent. also adding raX interface type, which is kind of
	  uncommon.

2005-03-13 18:19  sofar

	* sbin/lin: Proposed consistency fix for lin/download queue
	  creation: use find_depends()

2005-03-13 17:08  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/check.lunar: Removing obsolete call to
	  show_owner.

2005-03-09 19:11  moe

2005-03-09 15:26  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/recovery.lunar: Suggested by florin, also

2005-03-09 13:17  moe

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/prune.lunar: Fixing lunar prune for good.
	  God, this has been bothering me. Might break things .. but this
	  is theedge ;-) However, I've been giving it a good test.

2005-03-08 07:48  moe

	* usr/share/man/man8/lfirsttime.8: Typo

2005-03-07 23:08  moe

	* usr/share/man/man8/lfirsttime.8: Tweaks and typo fixes. Also
	  added a hint to the hint section.

2005-03-07 22:03  moe

	* usr/share/man/man8/lfirsttime.8: I finally got to rewriting
	  lfirsttime. This should be _alot_ better then the manpage we had
	  until now. Thanks rolling out to Jens, Jasper and Jaime for
	  typo-hunting. I feel dizzy now.

	* etc/lunar/config: Adding the X11 path to the static lunar PATH

2005-02-14 13:01  nestu

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/kernel.lunar: * get rid of the annoying
	  grub install questions (adding a warning that it should be
	  installed).  * add a white line between kernel entries.

2005-02-14 11:48  sofar

	* etc/lunar/config: We should use a hardcoded PATH, no user
	  components allowed by default! This also solves /sbin/ldconfig
	  not being accessible on some systems etc. Note user can still
	  override PATH with `lunar set PATH xxxxx`, but it's not exported
	  to sub-apps.

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/build.lunar: meh... suck
