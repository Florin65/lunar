	* bin/lvu, var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: Much better
	  implementation of the URL alternatives: this creates a decent
	  picklist and insterts alternatives for known MIRROR clusters
	  automatically in the list. Lvu urls needs some more work but is
	  acceptable.

2005-04-01 10:17  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/messages.lunar: Extended debugging
	  support: use -dd -ddd -dddd or even -ddddd to increase debug
	  level

	* var/lib/lunar/: functions/optimize.lunar, menu/optimize.menu:
	  Adding a switch for -Wl,as-needed to reduce the amount of linked
	  in libraries. Faster startups? possibly. Could prove useful.

	* sbin/lrm: cosmetic warning fix

2005-03-30 13:10  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/sustained: These are no longer needed in here (the

2005-03-28 13:26  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/plugins/check-md5sum.plugin: locale-fix: do not
	  rely on 'FAILED' in the output, since in spanish it is "TU MADRE"

	* var/lib/lunar/: functions/kernel.lunar, functions/plugins.lunar,

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/: check.lunar, modules.lunar,

	  consistent in using base functions, rewrite md5sum_check slightly

2005-03-20 14:57  sofar

2005-03-15 11:38  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/messages.lunar: New query() routine: bad

2005-03-13 21:56  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/connect.lunar: this is much more
	  consistent. also adding raX interface type, which is kind of
	  uncommon.

2005-03-13 18:19  sofar

	* sbin/lin: Proposed consistency fix for lin/download queue
	  creation: use find_depends()

2005-03-13 17:08  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/check.lunar: Removing obsolete call to

	* usr/share/man/man8/lfirsttime.8: Some tweaks. Two new hints.

2005-03-09 15:26  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/recovery.lunar: Suggested by florin, also

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/prune.lunar: wheeps .. committed a
	  slightly older version. This is the final solution.

2005-03-09 13:17  moe

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/prune.lunar: Fixing lunar prune for good.
	  God, this has been bothering me. Might break things .. but this
	  is theedge ;-) However, I've been giving it a good test.

2005-03-08 07:48  moe

2005-03-07 22:03  moe

	* usr/share/man/man8/lfirsttime.8: I finally got to rewriting
	  lfirsttime. This should be _alot_ better then the manpage we had
	  until now. Thanks rolling out to Jens, Jasper and Jaime for
	  typo-hunting. I feel dizzy now.

2005-02-22 12:50  moe

	* etc/lunar/config: Adding the X11 path to the static lunar PATH

2005-02-14 13:01  nestu

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/kernel.lunar: * get rid of the annoying
	  grub install questions (adding a warning that it should be
	  installed).  * add a white line between kernel entries.

2005-02-14 11:48  sofar

	* etc/lunar/config: We should use a hardcoded PATH, no user
	  components allowed by default! This also solves /sbin/ldconfig
	  not being accessible on some systems etc. Note user can still
	  override PATH with `lunar set PATH xxxxx`, but it's not exported
	  to sub-apps.

2005-02-02 12:12  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/build.lunar: meh... suck
