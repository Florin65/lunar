	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/aliases.lunar,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: Some more
	  optimizations in the most time-consuming parts.

2006-02-12 05:48  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Optimizations
	  and safety : use awk instead of combined grep/cuts, obsolete use
	  of cat.

2006-02-08 18:44  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/misc.lunar: Code speedup -
	  don't run readlink unneededly a lot.

2006-02-07 23:03  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/aliases.lunar: Bugfix - tried
	  to exec $() wrongly.

2006-02-01 21:06  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/build.lunar: Add version
	  number to the message 'building xxx'.

2006-02-01 16:52  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/usr/share/man/man8/lin.8: Did some mild updating.

2006-01-23 03:46  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/build.lunar: Typo fix.

2006-01-16 17:53  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: layout changes:
	  - entire question is now yellow * except for the (is/isnot
	  installed word) * and the description of the optional dependency -
	  highlighted installed dependency in green - highlighted missing
	  dependency in red - reduced "not yet installed" to "not installed"
	  - reduced "already installed" to "installed" - removed the word
	  "dependency" hope that cleans it up a bit.

2006-01-13 17:14  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/init.lunar: Don't assume uid 0
	  == root, instead check if uid($USER) == 0, allows to change the
	  root username to something else. (/me waves to redkennedy).

2006-01-10 01:00  v3rt1g0

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/build.lunar: Changing this
	  back just a bit after talking to sofar. No need to run ./configure
	  twice (as most ./autogen.sh scripts already call configure). Added
	  some of the output that is now in _configure back into the
	  default_cvs_config. Yours Truly, The Lazy Impatient!

2006-01-09 17:43  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/build.lunar: * add /var/games
	  as suggested in the ML * add a _configure wrapper that skips the
	  ./configure step if a Makefile is present but ./configure is
	  missing (fallback operation). Bombs out when both are awol.
	  Redirected all ./configure calls to _configure.

2005-12-31 04:10  tchan

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Fixed some
	  technically incorrect uses of parentheses inside a bash echo
	  command. Parens need to be backslash escaped, like "echo ADDON=\(
	  None \)"

2005-12-28 00:28  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/plugins/download-generic.plugin: tchan>

2005-12-26 02:21  sofar

	* lunar/branches/stable/var/lib/lunar/aliases,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/aliases: Deleted into oblivion (see
	  moonbase/aliases).

2005-12-19 18:13  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: Fix for
	  file:/// urls - I need those to work so I can offline work on the
	  lunar iso while at work with a snapshot moonbase =^)

2005-12-19 04:00  tchan

	* lunar/trunk/usr/share/man/man8/lfirsttime.8: Fixed a LOT of typos
	  and some really poor grammar.

2005-12-19 03:43  tchan

2005-12-13 03:42  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/bin/lvu: Yep, indeed zbigniew was right - should be
	  fine now - I must have overlooked something.

2005-12-12 04:25  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar,

2005-11-11 20:00  sofar

	* lunar/branches/stable/etc/lunar/mirrors/LRESORT,
	  lunar/trunk/etc/lunar/mirrors/LRESORT: Merged Moe's changes and
	  removed my puny nl.lunar-linux.org mirror from the list as it is
	  no longer serving download content (it's just acting as a backup
	  server now mirroring our svn repos and torrents).

2005-11-11 19:53  moe

	* lunar/trunk/etc/lunar/mirrors/LRESORT: Lets give this another try
	  .. I'm sure that the last time it failed. Updating mirror urls.

2005-11-09 19:56  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/bin/lvu, lunar/trunk/usr/share/man/man1/lvu.1: New
	  feature: `lvu expired`, shows a list of modules which need an
	  update, including old an new version numbers.

2005-11-06 07:15  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Final
	  modifications - prolly still not bugfree but it seems to work ;^).

	* lunar/trunk/sbin/lunar,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/menu/license.menu: More license code:
	  add lunar menus and some default handling code. see ML for
	  additional info.

2005-11-03 18:13  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/menu/optimize.menu: Who is this Janne
	  and why is he bothering me with these ... oh wait this is a nice
	  patch ;^).

2005-11-03 05:23  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/install: Brilliant idea from Janne Johansson.

	* lunar/trunk/sbin/lin,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Prototype
	  LICENSE code: use lunar set {ACCEPTED,REJECTED}_LICENSES to adjust
	  it. These variables can contain more license names. We still need
	  to decide on license names.

2005-10-20 18:46  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/etc/lunar/config: * removed max_sources as it's
	  properly initialized in the code already * removed specific
	  mirrors for moonbase, replaced by * generic
	  download.lunar-linux.org for moonbase second URL fallback *
	  generic download.lunar-linux.org for LRESORT and PATCH URL's

2005-10-17 23:27  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/sbin/lunar: Fix lunar hold menu being broken -
	  elangelo should have filed a bugreport first but I'm feeling nice
	  today :^P

2005-10-14 03:37  v3rt1g0

	  theedge.

2005-10-13 20:18  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: Somehow
	  sort_by_dependency was a dud, this code actually speeds it up a
	  bit and gives correct output for me where it was previously not
	  doing that.

2005-10-10 20:51  tchan

	* lunar/trunk/etc/lunar/mirrors/GNOME: Fixed the planetmirror GNOME
	  URL.

2005-09-29 14:38  tchan

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: I got tired of
	  watching the Deprecated -mcpu messages scroll by, so I removed the
	  -mcpu from the x86 section of optimize.lunar. -march implies
	  -mtune which is the replacement for -mcpu on x86 platforms in
	  gcc-3.4.x. So if anyone is still using gcc-3.3.x this won't break
	  anything as -march there also implies -mcpu.

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/build.lunar: This is the
	  commit to go along with my Dev-ML email (subject: Addition to
	  build.lunar common functions) sent on 18Sep05. This adds a
	  default_game_build and default_game_config as options to be used
	  in BUILD files. This commit also fixes a few minor typos. !!!!!!
	  Please DO NOT use these two functions in any modules that are in
	  the moonbase. This code is being commited here so that devs can
	  easily test the new code. Once it has been tested/approved the
	  change can then be pushed the lunar and both theedge and lunar can
	  get a version bump before we can start making use of it, else
	  stuff will break for the user. !!!!!!!

2005-07-31 14:35  tchan

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/tracking.lunar: Fixing the bug

	  lunar/branches/stable/etc/lunar/mirrors/SFORGE,
	  lunar/trunk/bin/lvu, lunar/trunk/etc/lunar/mirrors/SFORGE:
	  Modified 'lvu urls' so that it lists ALL mirror sites but never
	  last resort/first resort urls. this makes it produce the same list
	  everywhere. Also adding the crappy osdn.sf.net mirror.

2005-07-27 07:24  sofar

	* lunar/branches/stable/var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: Bugfix: the
	  '/' at the end of a URL may be missing like in the case of

2005-07-25 09:49  sofar

2005-07-21 19:14  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/etc/lunar/mirrors/LRESORT: Adding the second mirror in

2005-06-30 14:08  sofar

2005-06-30 12:27  sofar

2005-06-30 12:15  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Allow nested

	  in zlocal for instance.

2005-06-30 12:03  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/bin/lvu: Feature addition: lvu diff [locally edited
	  module] -> create a unidiff suited for submission.

2005-06-24 13:22  tchan

	* lunar/trunk/etc/lunar/config: Yet another hack to fix the double
	  "/" problem in the MIRRORS, especially SFORGE.

2005-06-18 21:39  tchan

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/plugins/unpack-generic.plugin: Fixed a
	  bug in the assumptions on how source modules are named. NOT all
	  source code is *.tar.gz, see pwlib and openh323 modules (these are
	  named *-tar.gz). I changed the unpack code from *.tar.bz2 to
	  *tar.bz2 and similiarly *.tar.gz to *tar.gz. sofar needs to look
	  at this when he gets back!!!

2005-06-13 15:25  moe

	* lunar/trunk/etc/lunar/mirrors/SFORGE: Why am I unable to commit to

	  sf.net downloads

2005-06-08 11:33  sofar

	* lunar/branches/stable/bin/lvu, lunar/trunk/bin/lvu: Adding a

	  specify date using -R format. Hopefully it'll make Moe happier.

2005-06-07 15:25  sofar

	* lunar/branches/stable/var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar,

2005-06-06 14:03  sofar

	* lunar/branches/stable/bin/lvu, lunar/trunk/bin/lvu: Bad typo fix.

2005-06-06 13:21  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/make,

	  plugins out of all non-core post-build code 3. moved bash and
	  xinetd plugin code into moonbase to make it really pluggable 4.
	  Cleaned up a few small pieces of code 5. added 'local'
	  declarations as much as possible everywhere!!! 6. removed the
	  dummy calls to update_lilo/grub

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/updatelog.lunar: Fix moonbase
	  display changes. Note create_depends_cache ()'-ed

2005-05-10 12:37  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/sbin/lin: Don't let WANT_VERSION trickle into the
	  version number needed for dependencies (This is also the first
	  commit performed through HTTP+DAV+SSL!)

2005-05-09 14:50  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/check.lunar,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: Hopefully this
	  will fix the 'alias' bug on 'lunar fix' including 'lunar update'
	  etc... The satisfy_depends code now has explicit NEVER_ASK and
	  internally discards an alias if it should be bassed by
	  find_depends. I still don't get who the unalias code doesn't find
	  the proper alias for this case, but it works. Also added a slight
	  hint more information (-v level).

	* lunar/trunk/bin/lvu: EEEK I unpatched lvu submit :^(

2005-05-08 15:17  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/menu/optimize.menu: Typo fix: CC_OPTS
	  wasn't displayed correctly.

2005-05-07 21:17  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: Internally
	  adjust for in_depends() change.

2005-05-07 20:32  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Optimization
	  fix for LDFLAGS, and also a very outdated fix I think is needed
	  for a lot of things-> in_depends() function.

2005-05-06 16:36  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Fix for this
	  recently discovered bug: http://lunar-linux.org/?q=node/view/835.
	  I'm also allowing -S to be passed as we have sufficient protection
	  now from new sers that they should check the sanity of their
	  optimizations.

2005-05-06 16:16  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/menu/optimize.menu: I'm a basterd: now
	  it's completely intuitive to just press 'yes' which will NOT
	  change the safety off. I love designing GUI's =^DDDD.

2005-05-06 16:05  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/menu/optimize.menu: Adding SAFETY switch
	  to the lunar optimizations. This will prohibit setting of non-safe
	  optimizations (very restrictive). Also in non-restricted mode, you
	  STILL cannot choose sse2 if /proc/cpuinfo doesn't list that
	  Feature ;^). There is a very very serious warning when people turn
	  off the safety switch. (schweet!).

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/protected: AAARGH mailman panic!!!

2005-05-05 14:46  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/bin/lvu: Lvu from output without version number but
	  with the matched files, easy to process and read now.

2005-05-04 20:58  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Fixed missing
	  Blocks) case entry and cleaned up some utterly useless code.

2005-05-04 11:23  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/menu/optimize.menu: Again a typo.

2005-05-04 11:17  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/menu/optimize.menu: typo fix.

2005-05-04 11:00  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/sbin/lunar,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/menu/optimize.menu: Inserting the new
	  optimization menu which shows a global menu from which item can be
	  accessed directly. Also rewrote and renamed the core routines, and
	  moved the menu code to the .menu file exclusively. You might have
	  to re-set your optimizations!

2005-04-30 21:46  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/bin/lvu: Modified `lvu submit` to allow non-zlocal
	  modules to be submitted.

2005-04-26 15:51  sofar

	* lunar/trunk, theedge/trunk: theedge/trunk is now lunar/trunk !
