	* bin/lvu: Rewrote snapshot handling: *ONLY* consider lunar
	  configs, leave /etc/ out... it just doesn't add anything and
	  breaks more.

2005-04-21 10:39  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: grmbl. look behind you!

2005-04-21 10:32  sofar

	* bin/lvu, var/lib/lunar/functions/aliases.lunar,
	  var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar,
	  var/lib/lunar/functions/messages.lunar: Alias fixes: add a
	  'NEVER_ASK' flag for the two occurences where this is absolutely
	  required: lvu (s)tree and sort_by_dependency. For safety I
	  removed the STDIN pipe to unalias in that function as well. Since
	  sort_by_dependency removes aliases automatically the sort order
	  isn't disturbed, and lvu will show the aliases if they're not
	  installed just the way it should.

2005-04-21 09:20  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/: modules.lunar, moonbase.lunar: Two
	  speedups: don't linger executing code if not needed.

2005-04-20 08:38  sofar

	* bin/lvu: lvu from now displays the results with a space as
	  delimiter which allows all sorts of re-use stuff.

2005-04-18 11:48  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/messages.lunar: don't use /dev/stderr,
	  but rather /proc/self/fd/2

2005-04-15 07:27  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/misc.lunar: prevent expansion of
	  wildcards. closes #795

2005-04-13 14:42  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/protected: removing nonsense $PROTECTED entries.

2005-04-13 09:52  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/aliases.lunar: This should at least fix
	  some of the alias problems that ratler had.

2005-04-13 08:02  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/aliases.lunar: Much more powerfull
	  aliasing code: really track all possible alias possibilities,
	  survives 'lunar fixdepends' test.

2005-04-12 07:34  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/: functions/download.lunar,
	  plugins/download-generic.plugin: Move the appending of '/' to
	  URL's to the wget method only, the other methods do not
	  concatenate the URL with the FILE part.

2005-04-08 10:46  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/moonbase.lunar: slippy fingers today

2005-04-08 10:45  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/moonbase.lunar: Now I get it ;^)

2005-04-08 10:33  sofar

	* etc/lunar/config: Damn, I forgot these all along!

2005-04-07 09:36  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: I thought I typed that

2005-04-07 09:19  sofar

	* bin/lvu, var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar,
	  var/lib/lunar/plugins/download-file.plugin,
	  var/lib/lunar/plugins/download-generic.plugin: API change:
	  separately pass the filename argument when downloading and
	  verifying files (url, filename, target dir)

2005-04-07 08:59  sofar

	* etc/lunar/: config, mirrors/GNOME, mirrors/GNU, mirrors/KDE,
	  mirrors/KERNEL, mirrors/LRESORT, mirrors/SFORGE, mirrors/XFREE86:
	  Adjusting all URL's so they end with '/'

2005-04-06 15:18  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/: build.lunar, plugins.lunar: Fix for
	  postbuild not installing plugins: force installation

2005-04-06 07:44  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: Bugfix: second and
	  further sources were not downloaded.

2005-04-05 08:47  sofar

	* sbin/lin: Adding brackets solves this too =^)

2005-04-05 05:26  tchan

	* sbin/lin: Reverting sofar's change to lin because he just broke
	  the ability to do, for example:  "lin automake autoconf".  2nd
	  module always fails because BUILD_DIRECTORY is set to 1st modules
	  source_dir <---- bzzzzt!!!! Not good! sofar will have to fix this
	  correctly when he has some time.  At least now I can do "lin
	  module1 module2 module3" again.

2005-04-04 22:33  moe

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: well, you forgot about
	  it, right sofar? (I won't mind since you created a 5GB svn tree
	  today ;)

2005-04-04 13:36  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/plugins/download-generic.plugin: Add generic
	  https:// to the plugins (needed for cvs module)

2005-04-04 11:22  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Replacing an expensive
	  call with efficient code

2005-04-04 11:11  sofar

	* sbin/lin, var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar,
	  var/lib/lunar/functions/moonbase.lunar: Two changes: reinstate
	  moonbase changelog (was somehow broken) Make lin a single thread
	  and not call itself but rather call the main() function again
	  (which retains cmdline settings like debug, verbose, etc)

2005-04-02 15:43  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: Rather elegant and simple
	  fix for CVS/SVN/etc NEED_REFRESH checks: only check ${URLS[0]}
	  for this, the rest would be nonsense anyway.

2005-04-02 10:27  sofar

	* bin/lvu, var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: Much better
	  implementation of the URL alternatives: this creates a decent
	  picklist and insterts alternatives for known MIRROR clusters
	  automatically in the list. Lvu urls needs some more work but is
	  acceptable.

2005-04-01 10:17  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/messages.lunar: Extended debugging
	  support: use -dd -ddd -dddd or even -ddddd to increase debug
	  level

2005-04-01 07:21  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/plugins/unpack-generic.plugin: Fix by....
	  KONGAR!!!! =^D

2005-03-31 13:09  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/: functions/optimize.lunar, menu/optimize.menu:
	  Adding a switch for -Wl,as-needed to reduce the amount of linked
	  in libraries. Faster startups? possibly. Could prove useful.

2005-03-31 08:09  sofar

	* sbin/lrm: cosmetic warning fix

2005-03-30 13:10  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/sustained: These are no longer needed in here (the
	  less the better)

2005-03-30 11:25  sofar

	  are left behind.

2005-03-28 23:53  v3rt1g0

	* sbin/lsh: Just a little typo that has been bugging me.

2005-03-28 13:26  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/plugins/check-md5sum.plugin: locale-fix: do not
	  rely on 'FAILED' in the output, since in spanish it is "TU MADRE"

2005-03-27 22:02  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/: functions/kernel.lunar, functions/plugins.lunar,
	  plugins/bootloader-grub.plugin, plugins/bootloader-lilo.plugin:
	  Moving bootloader code to plugins: we need to move the plugins
	  out to the moonbase-modules later on.

2005-03-25 17:56  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/: functions/check.lunar, functions/plugins.lunar,
	  plugins/check-find.plugin, plugins/check-ldd.plugin,
	  plugins/check-md5sum.plugin, plugins/check-symlinks.plugin:
	  Rewriting fix code: - now plugins instead of one large file -
	  lunar fix/nofix now runs better per-module - global lunar
	  fix/nofix doesn't perform expensive ld_export overhead

2005-03-25 15:54  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: Optimize performance of
	  depends code a bit more

2005-03-25 15:53  sofar

	* bin/lvu: Remove remainder of versioned modules

2005-03-25 11:11  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/plugins/unpack-generic.plugin: Adding plain tar
	  files too =^)

	  var/lib/lunar/plugins/unpack-generic.plugin,
	  var/lib/lunar/plugins/unpack-rpm.plugin,
	  var/lib/lunar/plugins/unpack-zip.plugin: Fix lvu urls: now lists
	  ALL urls!!! Migrate unpack() to use plugins for all types (allows
	  zip and rpm code to be migrated out of core later)

2005-03-24 16:38  sofar

2005-03-23 00:23  hardkrash

	* bin/lvu: Cleaning up the activity log so that it only finds the
	  actual module Not other modules with the string of module name in
	  it

2005-03-20 16:53  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/: check.lunar, modules.lunar,
	  recovery.lunar: Reworking some checks and code to be more
	  consistent in using base functions, rewrite md5sum_check slightly

2005-03-20 14:57  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/: check.lunar, locking.lunar: This allows
	  'lunar fixdepends' to rebuild the depends/depends.backup files if
	  they are nonexistant, and thus empty too!

2005-03-18 22:50  sofar

2005-03-15 11:38  sofar

2005-03-13 21:56  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/connect.lunar: this is much more
	  consistent. also adding raX interface type, which is kind of
	  uncommon.

2005-03-13 18:19  sofar

	* sbin/lin: Proposed consistency fix for lin/download queue
	  creation: use find_depends()

2005-03-13 17:08  sofar

2005-03-07 22:03  moe

	* usr/share/man/man8/lfirsttime.8: I finally got to rewriting

	  typo-hunting. I feel dizzy now.

2005-02-22 12:50  moe
