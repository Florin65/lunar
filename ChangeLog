	* var/lib/lunar/functions/: install.lunar, messages.lunar: added
	xterm status messages

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: Just pushing around the
	formatting again

2003-11-14 17:37  tchan

	* var/state/lunar/: blacklist.Alpha, blacklist.PowerPC,
	blacklist.SPARC: The current module for uClibc will only compile on
	x86.  uClibc does support other architectures, but the Lunar module
	is currently setup for x86 ONLY!

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/install.lunar: Always keep a copy of the
	scripts used to create a module. This is intended to be useful for
	general backtracking, debugging and to provide an adjunct to the
	activity file to know what's been done without resorting to cvs
	history.
	
	Also safeguards local development work for devs who overwrite their
	work with 'lin moonbase' and the like (and yes this is the *real*
	reason for adding this little hack).
	
	Adding this to post_install because at this point we know that we
	have a successful install (logs and everything have in theory been
	created by the time we get here.

	* sbin/lin, var/lib/lunar/compilers/cc,
	var/lib/lunar/compilers/gcc, var/lib/lunar/functions/install.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/main.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/moonbase.lunar: Syncing some fixes:
	
	 - compiler wrappers showed wrong compile call
	 - get_moonbase breakage detection
	 - cpan:// module installing native supported (need to commit
	example modules, please be patient)
	 - autoresurrect logging disabled (too much noise in logs,
	especially with sound on).

	* var/lib/lunar/: functions/optimize.lunar, menu/optimize.menu:
	Updated the SPARC sections of optimize.lunar and optimize.menu. 
	Still needs some work in the CPU hint section as "cat
	/proc/cpuinfo" does NOT return a "model type" string -- instead it
	returns a "type" string and a "cpu" string.

	the version-extraversion id in the kernl Makefile

2003-10-06 02:08  elaine

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/kernel.lunar: Added installwatch
	frobbing, hacked and added grub and lilo stanza makers (w/
