	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Adding gecc support to optimizations.
	
2002-10-14 19:29  xoritor

	* sbin/lget, sbin/lin, var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Adding support for CVS co/up to lget.
	Adding support for building sources from CVS to lin.
	Adding KEEP_SOURCE var to allow needed sources to be kept.
	Adding support for checking CVS source dirs in subroutines.
	
2002-10-14 14:02  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Adding input box for $MAKES
	
2002-10-08 04:32  tchan

	* var/state/lunar/blacklist.x86: Removed ddd from the blacklist.  It now correctly compiles with gcc-3.2.
	
2002-10-05 05:39  tchan

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Fixed a long standing bug on why the /usr/share/info/dir file keeps getting
	trashed.  prepare_install was not saving /usr/share/info/dir and that file
	is being tracked by installwatch so it becomes part of the tar.bz2 file.
	So inside prepare_install, if the module is already installed, it removes
	the existing module before completing the install.  This would remove
	the exisiting /usr/share/info/dir and then replace it with a very short
	version of /usr/share/info/dir.
	
2002-10-03 16:51  xoritor

	* sbin/lin: Added the call to check_blacklist() that was left out.
	
2002-10-03 15:55  xoritor

	* var/state/lunar/: blacklist.x86, gcc.x86: Removing gcc.x86 list (unused)
	Adding blacklist.x86 with contents:
	  ddd
	  rythmbox
	  gstreamer
	
2002-10-03 15:50  xoritor

	* sbin/lin: Fixed the issue with --fix installing "held" modules.  this will no longer happen.
	Added support for a "blacklist" again it is still in /var/state/lunar, but the aname has changed to blacklist.$PLATFORM (defaults to x86).  This will NOT let a blacklisted module install at all and terminates lin when a blacklisted module is encountered.  I realize this could cause issues, and I am looking for a better solution... feel free to post ideas.
	
2002-10-01 17:34  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: lin moonbase now explicitly rebuilds the module.index
	
2002-09-29 20:10  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Adding prune code for compile, install and md5sum logsfiles
	
2002-09-28 03:37  tchan

	* var/state/lunar/gcc.x86: Removed cdrdao from the list.  It builds just fine for me with gcc-3.2.
	
2002-09-27 18:42  xoritor

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Fixed formatting errors.
	
2002-09-25 22:01  sofar

2002-09-25 18:32  sofar

	* sbin/lin: re-adding wrappers to normal installation
	
2002-09-25 18:04  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Adding message when a .rc file is installed!
	
2002-09-25 17:35  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Fix for CVS moonbases
	
2002-09-24 20:49  xoritor

	* sbin/lin: Fixing linewrap/editor errors... thx niki :-)
	
2002-09-24 16:59  xoritor

	* sbin/lin: Updating lin to not set PATH, other than to add for the wrappers.  Added an echo to say wether a module is blacklisted or not, but does not do anything but echo.  This is a placeholder for future code that will allow a blacklist for gcc 2x or optimization unfriendly modules to be easily identified.
	
2002-09-24 16:52  xoritor

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Adding PSAFE to optimize_make().
	  PSAFE=no can be added to a DETAILS file to set MAKES=1 so that multiple makes do not occur
	
2002-09-24 02:51  tchan

	* var/state/lunar/gcc.x86: unrar now compiles with gcc-3.2 or greater.
	
2002-09-23 23:59  sofar

	* sbin/lin, usr/share/man/man8/lin.8, var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Adding proper fix for lin --fix: lin --fixdepends will ONLY rebuild your depends database, without recompiling modules!
	
2002-09-23 21:03  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Incremental numbered backups removed: they might confuse xinetd! Just don't cp a new version if it already exists, since most likely the SA modified it and we should leave it alone.
	
2002-09-23 12:03  kongar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: 
	now backing up /etc/xinet.d/module files, numbered backups.
	
2002-09-22 07:05  tchan

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Hacked subroutines to support the creation of /tmp/depends.updated to aide
	in edit/repair of /var/state/lunar/depends.  This will prevent massive
	recompiling of the entire lunar box when the depends file gets out of
	whack.
	
2002-09-22 07:03  tchan

	* sbin/lin: Hacked lin to support /var/state/lunar/depends editing/repair using the
	file /tmp/depends.updated.

	Apply patches from lunar to theedge
	
2002-09-20 16:07  tchan

	* var/state/lunar/gcc.x86: Removed several SDL* modules as they have been compiling and working with
	gcc-3.2 for a while now.
	
2002-09-20 15:36  tchan

	* var/state/lunar/gcc.x86: Removed smpeg from this list as it compiles correctly now with gcc-3.2,
	after applying wyatt_earp's fix.
	
2002-09-20 15:20  tchan

	* bin/lvu: Fixed the spacing in the help section for the new "lvu cd" sub-command.
	
2002-09-20 11:17  kongar

	* bin/lvu: 
	implemented "lvu cd <module>" functionality
	
2002-09-18 21:35  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/menu/optimize.menu: preserve $MAKES
	
2002-09-18 09:26  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Fixing order of distcc (ccache distcc gcc and not distcc ccache gcc), and adding distcc to the c++ compiler addons, since mozilla and others compiled fine with it.
	
2002-09-12 23:53  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/compilers/c++: Adding c++ wrapper
	
2002-09-10 23:19  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/protected: removing /usr/bin/grep since it's obsolete in that location.
	
2002-09-10 22:51  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/protected: Major bugfix: lin grep will no longer wipe your /var/state/lunar/packages
	
2002-09-10 01:24  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/: functions/optimize.lunar, menu/optimize.menu: Enhanced menu's for optimizations: these remember what was previously set!
	
2002-09-09 23:26  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Fixes the multiple cpu-features bug
	
2002-09-05 23:22  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: now uses bzcat instead of deprecated -y
	
2002-09-05 14:06  sofar

	* etc/lunar/config, sbin/lin, var/lib/lunar/compilers/cc,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar,

2002-09-05 13:02  kongar

	* sbin/lin: 
	xinetd installation now neglects CVS subdirs
	
	it is not possible to select xinetd AND init.d, it is now
	either xinetd OR init.d
	
2002-09-04 16:37  tchan

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/: optimize.lunar, optimize.lunar.sofar: Fixed optimize.lunar, again, to just plain export CC,CCC,CXX, with no conditional
	testing.
	
2002-09-03 13:54  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: only restart xinetd if the init.d script is available
	
2002-09-03 13:49  sofar

	* sbin/lin: Make sure pwd is back to normal
	
2002-09-03 13:48  sofar

	* sbin/lin: reworked probe tests more decently
	
2002-09-02 17:21  sofar

	* usr/share/man/man8/lunar.8: updated man page for new functionality
	
2002-09-02 16:45  tchan

	* var/lib/lunar/menu/optimize.menu: Commented out the DEBUG strip option from the Lunar menus.  It breaks too
	many builds and there is no good way to fix this right now in Lunar.  Commented
	out with Xoritor's blessing!
	
2002-09-02 02:38  tchan

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Okay, this version of optimize.lunar incorporates sofar's "menu checklist"
	fix but does NOT include his nowrap code which is still broken.  This version
	correctly has niki's fix for the Debug strip optimization.  sofar needs to
	check the sense of his [ -n $NOWRAP ] test.  If I do NOT have $NOWRAP set,
	then I obviously want the lunar gcc wrappers but his code will NOT export
	the CC,CXX,CCC variables correctly.
	
2002-09-02 02:04  csm

2002-09-01 15:10  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/menu/download.menu: Fixed proper explanation of values in dl rate.
	
2002-09-01 04:24  niki

	  Enable calling of any ADDON, CC, CCC, and CXX options.
	  Calls one program so libtool does not die.
	  Fixes many compile issues with broken builds.
	  Enables ccache and distcc to work transparently.
	
	Requires lunar-gcc and lunar-g++ to be installed in /usr/bin, they will be in the installed by the gcc module.
	
2002-08-22 04:37  tchan

	* usr/sbin/: lget, lin, lrm, lrm2, lunar, lvis, lvu: Moved these files to /sbin.  lvu moved to /bin.  This is for the people that
	have /usr on a seperate partition.  The lunar tools have to be available.
	
2002-08-22 03:04  tchan

	* install: Modified this to add the /bin and /sbin directories.
	
2002-08-22 03:02  tchan
