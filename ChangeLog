	* var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: Some CVS handling code cleanups that revealed problems... perhaps this solves Moe's issues.
	
2003-07-23 22:54  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/: build.lunar, install.lunar,
	sources.lunar: Fixing a bug that niki spotted, propagation of error result now comes from missing downloads down to lin_module, which exists before optimize now too. General order in pre-build stage improved too. Moving verify_source code out of build into sources.lunar.

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: Fixes for the SVN urls, symplifying svn and cvs ups.
	
2003-07-20 15:35  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/connect.lunar: since these 2 are a royal pain in the ass I decided to kick them into their own forget-me-file.
	
2003-07-20 15:34  sofar

	* bin/lvu, var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: Fixing lvu search bug, adding full support for svn:// urls, see moonbase/zbeta dor 2 example modules that use svn:// URL's.

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Again, fixed the typo of "PLATFOM" to be "PLATFORM".  This was fixed in
	a previous version of this code but was LOST in sofar's latest merge.

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: Error out when a dependency is exiled with a proper message.
	
2003-07-17 20:43  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/: download.lunar, edit.lunar,
	install.lunar, sources.lunar, useradd.lunar: Fixed some error messages (trying to uniformize them) and a fix for a broken download (unpack() croaking) error that resulted in unpack not logging the broken lin to activity log.
	
2003-07-17 20:19  sofar

	* bin/lvu, sbin/lin, var/lib/lunar/functions/build.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/install.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/uniqid.lunar: Some minor cosmetic fixes, run_details used better, especially in lvu, fixed a hang on use_initd. Moved conflicts() to depends.lunar, changed ID so the output of the wget command gets echoed to stdout (so we possibly can send out a motd).
	
2003-07-17 14:50  tchan

	* usr/share/man/man8/lunar.8: Added spaces to the optional parameters listing to make it format and read much
	better.
