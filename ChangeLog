	* var/lib/lunar/functions/prune.lunar: Fixing lunar prune for good.
	  God, this has been bothering me. Might break things .. but this
	  is theedge ;-) However, I've been giving it a good test.

	* usr/share/man/man8/lfirsttime.8: Tweaks and typo fixes. Also
	  added a hint to the hint section.

	* usr/share/man/man8/lfirsttime.8: I finally got to rewriting
	  lfirsttime. This should be _alot_ better then the manpage we had
	  until now. Thanks rolling out to Jens, Jasper and Jaime for
	  typo-hunting. I feel dizzy now.

	* etc/lunar/config: Adding the X11 path to the static lunar PATH

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/kernel.lunar: * get rid of the annoying
	  grub install questions (adding a warning that it should be
	  installed).  * add a white line between kernel entries.

	* etc/lunar/config: We should use a hardcoded PATH, no user
	  components allowed by default! This also solves /sbin/ldconfig
	  not being accessible on some systems etc. Note user can still
	  override PATH with `lunar set PATH xxxxx`, but it's not exported
	  to sub-apps.

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: adding opts for amd64's
	  (note that this can only be used by manually changing
	  /etc/lunar/local/optimizations )

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: Fix for possible wget
	  exploit
