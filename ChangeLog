	* usr/share/man/man8/lfirsttime.8: a few updates and cleanups

2003-02-01 16:26  sofar

	* sbin/lin: Cleaning up here: we don't really need that message
	since blacklist.x86 is EMPTY.

2003-02-01 15:56  sofar

	* var/state/lunar/: blacklist.x86, gcc.x86: Merging theedge in here
	too: gcc.x86 is obsolete for 4 months already, tossing it out. Also
	AFAIK most module in there compile anyway.

	* sbin/lget: Okay, here's the problem: you implement downloading
	with locking, so lin can call lget without worrying wether it is
	already downloading or now, now you add another download option,
	but you forget to add locking to that feature. As you can guess,
	when you try to install AND lin forces a download through that
	other feature, it will start to download it, and then probe for it
	again just before pre_build, because lin calls lget twice somehow.
	Not at all a problem, unless you forget to add the locking
	mechanism to the other feature, right? (short: implemented locking
	where it is needed, should fix download/lin problems of CVS
	modules)
