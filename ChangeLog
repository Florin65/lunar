	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Adding gecc support to
	optimizations.

2002-10-14 19:29  xoritor

	* sbin/lget, sbin/lin, var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Adding support
	for CVS co/up to lget.	Adding support for building sources from
	CVS to lin.  Adding KEEP_SOURCE var to allow needed sources to be
	kept.  Adding support for checking CVS source dirs in subroutines.

2002-10-14 14:02  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Adding input box for
	$MAKES

2002-10-08 04:32  tchan

	* var/state/lunar/blacklist.x86: Removed ddd from the blacklist. 
	It now correctly compiles with gcc-3.2.

2002-10-05 05:39  tchan

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Fixed a long standing bug on why the
	/usr/share/info/dir file keeps getting trashed.  prepare_install
	was not saving /usr/share/info/dir and that file is being tracked
	by installwatch so it becomes part of the tar.bz2 file.  So inside
	prepare_install, if the module is already installed, it removes the
	existing module before completing the install.	This would remove
	the exisiting /usr/share/info/dir and then replace it with a very
	short version of /usr/share/info/dir.

2002-10-03 16:51  xoritor

	* sbin/lin: Added the call to check_blacklist() that was left out.

2002-10-03 15:55  xoritor

	* var/state/lunar/: blacklist.x86, gcc.x86: Removing gcc.x86 list
	(unused) Adding blacklist.x86 with contents:   ddd   rythmbox  
	gstreamer

2002-10-03 15:50  xoritor

	* sbin/lin: Fixed the issue with --fix installing "held" modules. 
	this will no longer happen.  Added support for a "blacklist" again
	it is still in /var/state/lunar, but the aname has changed to
	blacklist.$PLATFORM (defaults to x86).	This will NOT let a
	blacklisted module install at all and terminates lin when a
	blacklisted module is encountered.  I realize this could cause
	issues, and I am looking for a better solution... feel free to post
	ideas.

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: lin moonbase now explicitly rebuilds
	the module.index

2002-09-29 20:10  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Adding prune code for compile, install
	and md5sum logsfiles

2002-09-28 03:37  tchan

	* var/state/lunar/gcc.x86: Removed cdrdao from the list.  It builds
	just fine for me with gcc-3.2.

2002-09-27 18:42  xoritor

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Fixed formatting errors.

2002-09-25 22:01  sofar

	* sbin/lin: REALLY fixing linewrap errors

2002-09-25 18:32  sofar

	* sbin/lin: re-adding wrappers to normal installation

2002-09-25 18:04  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Adding message when a .rc file is
	installed!

2002-09-25 17:35  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Fix for CVS moonbases

2002-09-24 20:49  xoritor

	* sbin/lin: Fixing linewrap/editor errors... thx niki :-)

2002-09-24 16:59  xoritor

	* sbin/lin: Updating lin to not set PATH, other than to add for the
	wrappers.  Added an echo to say wether a module is blacklisted or
	not, but does not do anything but echo.  This is a placeholder for
	future code that will allow a blacklist for gcc 2x or optimization
	unfriendly modules to be easily identified.

2002-09-24 16:52  xoritor

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Adding PSAFE to
	optimize_make().    PSAFE=no can be added to a DETAILS file to set
	MAKES=1 so that multiple makes do not occur

2002-09-24 02:51  tchan

	* var/state/lunar/gcc.x86: unrar now compiles with gcc-3.2 or
	greater.

2002-09-23 23:59  sofar

	* sbin/lin, usr/share/man/man8/lin.8, var/lib/lunar/subroutines:
	Adding proper fix for lin --fix: lin --fixdepends will ONLY rebuild
	your depends database, without recompiling modules!

2002-09-23 21:03  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Incremental numbered backups removed:
	they might confuse xinetd! Just don't cp a new version if it
	already exists, since most likely the SA modified it and we should
	leave it alone.

2002-09-23 12:03  kongar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: 
	now backing up /etc/xinet.d/module files, numbered backups.

2002-09-22 07:05  tchan

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Hacked subroutines to support the
	creation of /tmp/depends.updated to aide in edit/repair of
	/var/state/lunar/depends.  This will prevent massive recompiling of
	the entire lunar box when the depends file gets out of whack.

2002-09-22 07:03  tchan

	* sbin/lin: Hacked lin to support /var/state/lunar/depends
	editing/repair using the file /tmp/depends.updated.

2002-09-20 23:21  kc8apf

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: 
	More optimization fixes for alpha

2002-09-20 23:07  kc8apf

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: 
	Add proper build types for alpha

2002-09-20 21:51  kc8apf

	* etc/lunar/mirrors/GNOME, var/lib/lunar/menu/optimize.menu: 
	Apply patches from lunar to theedge

2002-09-20 16:07  tchan

	* var/state/lunar/gcc.x86: Removed several SDL* modules as they
	have been compiling and working with gcc-3.2 for a while now.

2002-09-20 15:36  tchan

	* var/state/lunar/gcc.x86: Removed smpeg from this list as it
	compiles correctly now with gcc-3.2, after applying wyatt_earp's
	fix.

2002-09-20 15:20  tchan

	* bin/lvu: Fixed the spacing in the help section for the new "lvu
	cd" sub-command.

2002-09-20 11:17  kongar

	* bin/lvu: 
	implemented "lvu cd <module>" functionality

2002-09-18 21:35  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/menu/optimize.menu: preserve $MAKES

2002-09-18 09:26  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Fixing order of distcc
	(ccache distcc gcc and not distcc ccache gcc), and adding distcc to
	the c++ compiler addons, since mozilla and others compiled fine
	with it.
