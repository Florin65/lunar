	* sbin/lin, sbin/lrm, var/lib/lunar/subroutines,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Fix for (1) tar error on cache, removed --verbose from lrm, cleaned up more code, unified verbose messages.
	
	Also, the remove_module which people assumed to be removed incedentally was removed again, since the call is made by lrm (l228,l296). PLEASE LEAVE IT OUT NOW, since doing this belongs in the lrm code.
	
2003-02-14 15:52  tchan

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Added back in the "missing" call to remove_modules.  I believe it is still
	required and was removed by sofar accidentally in his clean up.
