	* etc/lunar/mirrors/SFORGE: Adding 2 apparently new mirrors

2002-09-02 21:27  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/menu/download.menu: Adding menu switch for
	EXHAUSTIVE option

2002-09-02 21:05  sofar

	* sbin/lget: New feature: exhaustive mirror testing when
	downloading (EXHAUSTIVE=yes)

2002-09-02 19:54  sofar

	* etc/lunar/mirrors/SFORGE: TABS instead of SPACES

2002-09-02 18:42  sofar

	* etc/lunar/mirrors/LAST_RESORT, etc/lunar/mirrors/LRESORT,
	etc/lunar/mirrors/SFORGE, etc/lunar/mirrors/SOURCEFORGE,
	var/lib/lunar/menu/mirrors.menu: Renamed these for later more handy

2002-09-02 17:57  sofar

	* sbin/lin: reworked probe tests more decently

2002-09-02 17:21  sofar

	functionality

2002-09-02 16:45  tchan

	* var/lib/lunar/menu/optimize.menu: Commented out the DEBUG strip
	option from the Lunar menus.  It breaks too many builds and there
	is no good way to fix this right now in Lunar.	Commented out with
	Xoritor's blessing!

2002-09-02 02:38  tchan

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Okay, this version of
	optimize.lunar incorporates sofar's "menu checklist" fix but does
	NOT include his nowrap code which is still broken.  This version
	correctly has niki's fix for the Debug strip optimization.  sofar
	needs to check the sense of his [ -n $NOWRAP ] test.  If I do NOT
	have $NOWRAP set, then I obviously want the lunar gcc wrappers but
	his code will NOT export the CC,CXX,CCC variables correctly.

2002-09-02 02:04  csm

	* var/lib/lunar/menu/download.menu: Fixed proper explanation of
	values in dl rate.

2002-09-01 04:24  niki

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: The bug that is discribed
	in bug no. 75, has some how been reactivated, which i have disabled
	again. See the text in the file, or contact me Niki Guldbrand
	<nikig@vip.cybercity.dk> for further info.

2002-08-31 04:42  tchan

2002-08-22 21:47  xoritor

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Removed cc_optimize and
	ccc_optimize functions in order to better implement the wrapper
	method:   Enable calling of any ADDON, CC, CCC, and CXX options.   
	Calls one program so libtool does not die.    Fixes many compile
	issues with broken builds.    Enables ccache and distcc to work
	transparently.
	
	Requires lunar-gcc and lunar-g++ to be installed in /usr/bin, they
	will be in the installed by the gcc module.

2002-08-22 04:37  tchan

	* usr/sbin/: lget, lin, lrm, lrm2, lunar, lvis, lvu: Moved these
	files to /sbin.  lvu moved to /bin.  This is for the people that
	have /usr on a seperate partition.  The lunar tools have to be
	available.

2002-08-22 03:04  tchan

	* install: Modified this to add the /bin and /sbin directories.

2002-08-22 03:02  tchan

	* bin/lvu: Moved this file from /usr/sbin to /bin.  This helps with
	people who have /usr mounted as a seperate partition.  lvu is in
	/bin because non-root users can use it too!

2002-08-22 03:01  tchan

	* sbin/: lget, lin, lrm, lrm2, lunar, lvis: Moved these files from
	/usr/sbin to /sbin.  This helps with people who have /usr on a
