	* etc/lunar/config: changing the last resort URL to .org instead of .com
	
2003-02-06 10:08  sofar

	* sbin/lrm: heh, got scared?
	
2003-02-06 00:00  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Adding --keepconfig in here to get lunar renew working again, see lrm commit.
	
2003-02-05 23:53  sofar

	* sbin/lin: adding --keepconfig so config files stay untouched.
	
2003-02-05 23:52  sofar

	* sbin/lrm: First couple of fixes:
	
	* no bailout when no DETAILS found (lrm should be possible afterall the install log is there)
	* add --keepconfig in order prepare_install functions normally
	* missing md5sum should PRESERVE config files just in case, as we know lunar already makes good md5sums, and in case that feature is off bad things go happen
	* updated help.
	
	TODO:
	
	- add regex support for excluded/protected like /etc/.*\.conf
	- speed profile removal queue processing: it is *SLOW*, consider reimporting old lrm routine which constructs a large grep statement (hazardous: command line chars are expensive and bash can only handle so much)
	- test

	* var/lib/lunar/excluded: adding critical postfix files

	* lib/lsb/init-functions: Added 'mk_spid()' function, to be used on starting a daemon and modified
	'mk_pid()' and 'pidok()' functions to prevent lunar from wiping out the
	/var/run/*.pid files of daemons which create these files on thier own.
	This allows sshd to be restarted remotely, killing only the server process.

	* usr/share/man/man8/lfirsttime.8: a few updates and cleanups
	
2003-02-01 16:27  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: I thought I added this already
	
2003-02-01 16:26  sofar

	* sbin/lin: Cleaning up here: we don't really need that message since blacklist.x86 is EMPTY.

	* sbin/lget: Okay, here's the problem: you implement downloading with locking, so lin
	can call lget without worrying wether it is already downloading or now,
	now you add another download option, but you forget to add locking to that
	feature. As you can guess, when you try to install AND lin forces a download
	through that other feature, it will start to download it, and then probe
	for it again just before pre_build, because lin calls lget twice somehow. Not
	at all a problem, unless you forget to add the locking mechanism to the other
	feature, right? (short: implemented locking where it is needed, should fix
	download/lin problems of CVS modules)

	* sbin/lin: Finished updating xinet (bug 232)
	
2003-02-01 01:08  wizfactor

	* usr/share/man/man8/lfirsttime.8: Fixed some punctuation.
	
2003-01-30 05:17  tchan

	* usr/share/man/man8/lfirsttime.8: Updated lfirsttime with some more fixes.
	
2003-01-29 20:26  sofar

	* sbin/lunar: Fix for that nasty one bug.
	
2003-01-29 19:34  tchan

	* usr/share/man/man8/lfirsttime.8: Updated the URL's and added a bit more info.

	* bin/lvu, sbin/lin, sbin/lrm, sbin/lunar, usr/sbin/colony,
	var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Generalizing code: less is now replaced with view_file(), which also handles
	stdin of course. It also will use the $PAGER env variable for those who
	want to override it with their default pager. Small effort, big gain.
	
2003-01-29 10:28  sofar

	* bin/lvu, usr/share/man/man1/lvu.1: Adding functionality to view the logfile easier: 'lvu activity'
