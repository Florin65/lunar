	* sbin/lget, sbin/lin, var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/postbuild.lunar: deprecated use_cvs and the
	CVS_MODULE scheme, CVS is now 100% transparent. Hope to merge these
	changes into lunar soon.

2003-03-23 14:28  sofar

	* sbin/lin: typo

2003-03-20 00:04  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/updatelog.lunar: BEER for kongar!!!

2003-03-18 20:38  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: CVS code now handles cvs
	modules with paths (xfce-devel/xxx) and truncates the path from the
	tarball. This enables the xfce-cvs modules to be rewritten using
	the new cvs source scheme.

2003-03-17 23:56  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: misc cosmetic fix.

2003-03-16 22:23  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: bugfix: always write the
	proper tar file.

2003-03-16 21:47  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: New default_cvs_* functions to call
	autogen.sh

2003-03-16 20:59  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/: functions/download.lunar, menu/download.menu:
	adding fix for bad cvs tarfile, and introducing a cvs ipdate
	threshold, to make sure you don't hammer a cvs server (defaults to
	10 minutes)

2003-03-16 20:25  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: This seems needed. I'll keep it in
	here for a while.

2003-03-16 17:45  sofar

	* bin/lvu, sbin/lunar, var/lib/lunar/subroutines,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/edit.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/view.lunar: prune moved to lunar, moved
	code out of lvu.

2003-03-15 21:47  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: cosmetic fix for complete
	downloads.

2003-03-15 18:23  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/: subroutines, functions/depends.lunar,
	functions/download.lunar, functions/locking.lunar,
	functions/modules.lunar, functions/moonbase.lunar,
	functions/postbuild.lunar: Fixing all rm occurences.

2003-03-15 18:16  sofar

	* sbin/: lin, lrm, lunar: Fixing rm statements

2003-03-15 01:29  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/: subroutines, functions/download.lunar,
	functions/moonbase.lunar: New cvs handling code: uses SOURCE_URL
	and SOURCE. see gaim-cvs for example,note SOURCE_DIRECTORY becomes
	important. more vebosity and misc code cleanups elsewhere. Hope
	this works for everyone. Maybe tomorrow I'll look how this can be
	used for the xfce cvs modules, but this new scheme does not
	obliviate the old cvs handling code!!!

2003-03-13 05:03  nhudson

	* var/lib/lunar/sustained: 
	Ok this is a start of adding coreutils to Lunar.  I removed
	fileutils, sh-utils, and textutils and added in coreutils

2003-03-12 23:48  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/: subroutines, functions/download.lunar,
	functions/moonbase.lunar: get_moonbase is now in it's own file, and
	calls get_url to download, so any settings required are taken into
	consideration. Also added a little bit more verbosity info, and a
	*sub* version (hour after the dot) which is cosmetic only for
	logging purposes.

2003-03-08 22:40  dem

	* var/lib/lunar/excluded: This anoys the f*** out of me everytime
	it overwritters it

2003-03-06 23:39  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/excluded: protect the whole dir instead of 4 files.

2003-03-06 22:44  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/useradd.lunar: this is badly needed,
	considering adding this to lunar ASAP...

2003-03-05 23:19  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/: subroutines, functions/depends.lunar: More
	merging out of grouped functions: depends functions all now reside
	in depends.lunar

2003-03-05 22:57  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: show difference between optional and
	required depends.

2003-02-28 00:25  sofar

	* sbin/lget, var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: code cleanups:
	lget!
	
	- moved general functions into functions/download.lunar -
	structured code, no weird function names - molecularized code:
	download_module, get_url, become more atomic functions and less
	vague.	- made lget a dummy frontend, as it should be. lin may
	possibly completely skip lget now and run a download process
	internally.

2003-02-26 22:43  sofar

	* sbin/lrm, var/lib/lunar/subroutines,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Fixing the 'double module'
	bug I've been having and that might have occurred on some systems
	unnoticed. All module functions have been armed against possible
	packages corruption by a crashed lrm (where the packages file
	wasn't updated correctly).

2003-02-25 23:52  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: bugfix #199: remove_depends $MODULE
	will also remove OPTIONAL depends on $MODULE, so lin will prompt
	again if you want to install it or not.

2003-02-25 19:35  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: This is slightly too much IMO

2003-02-25 08:44  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: hmm, this seems more logical.

2003-02-24 22:55  sofar

	* sbin/lget, sbin/lin, sbin/lrm, var/lib/lunar/subroutines,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/edit.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/messages.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/postbuild.lunar: large rewrite of verbose
	messages:
	
	- verbose_msg is now a main function - the function always returns
	true hence fixing the wiped depends problem - migrated all calls to
	new scheme - split up lunar messages functions to messages.lunar -
	split up editing functions to edit.lunar - made lrm slightly less
	verbose

2003-02-24 20:01  kc8apf

	* var/lib/lunar/excluded: Add mailman site config to excluded

2003-02-22 20:26  csm

	* var/lib/lunar/excluded: adding a fe wmore files to the list

2003-02-22 16:11  sofar

	* sbin/lget: verbosity, better separating cvs/non-cvs.

2003-02-22 11:55  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: More verbosity in core functions:
	depends and optional_depends are much more verbose now.
