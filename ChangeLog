	* var/lib/lunar/functions/: depends.lunar, edit.lunar: bugfix #273,
	also minor code cleanups

2003-04-01 23:11  sofar

	* lib/lsb/init-functions: This looks at the PID file rather than in
	the process table, much more decent, no whining about PID's.
	Cleaned up some bad code. Reformatted, sprinkled with cheese too.

	* var/lib/lunar/: subroutines, functions/messages.lunar,
	functions/modules.lunar, functions/optimize.lunar,
	functions/sources.lunar: More moves, committing them in theedge
	only for now....

2003-04-01 18:33  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: BAH

2003-04-01 18:25  wizfactor

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Fixed typo

2003-03-31 20:32  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: Did not spot this typo
	before...

2003-03-30 20:45  sofar

	* usr/share/man/: man1/lvu.1, man8/lunar.8: updating these man
	pages!

2003-03-29 23:41  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: Better handling of
	depends: avoid unnecesary messages and edits

2003-03-27 17:41  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/updatelog.lunar: These 2 got left out...

2003-03-26 08:46  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/protected: adding dirname, since an update of
	coreutils shows lrm cannot find it.

2003-03-25 22:25  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/menu/dmodule.menu: Merging back niki's typo fix
	reported by Moe.

2003-03-24 20:55  kc8apf

	* var/lib/lunar/menu/optimize.menu: Stupid bug #2

2003-03-24 19:19  kc8apf

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Stupid mistake

2003-03-24 16:21  kc8apf

	* var/lib/lunar/: functions/optimize.lunar, menu/optimize.menu:
	Clean up options for Alpha CPUs

2003-03-24 08:20  sofar

	* sbin/lin: wheps

2003-03-24 00:22  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: BIG BIG BIG bugfix: lunar
	will now better find moved modules (umm, I say better, but I mean
	actually that lunar now actually finds them. I dunno what is better
	than that, so yeah, better).

2003-03-24 00:13  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: muuuuuch better

2003-03-23 23:43  sofar

	* sbin/lget, sbin/lin, var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/postbuild.lunar: deprecated use_cvs and the
	CVS_MODULE scheme, CVS is now 100% transparent. Hope to merge these
	changes into lunar soon.

2003-03-23 14:28  sofar

	* sbin/lin: typo

2003-03-20 00:04  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/updatelog.lunar: BEER for kongar!!!

2003-03-18 20:38  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: CVS code now handles cvs
	modules with paths (xfce-devel/xxx) and truncates the path from the
	tarball. This enables the xfce-cvs modules to be rewritten using
	the new cvs source scheme.

2003-03-17 23:56  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: misc cosmetic fix.

2003-03-16 22:23  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: bugfix: always write the
	proper tar file.

2003-03-16 21:47  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: New default_cvs_* functions to call
	autogen.sh

2003-03-16 20:59  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/: functions/download.lunar, menu/download.menu:
	adding fix for bad cvs tarfile, and introducing a cvs ipdate
	threshold, to make sure you don't hammer a cvs server (defaults to
	10 minutes)

2003-03-16 20:25  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: This seems needed. I'll keep it in
	here for a while.

2003-03-16 17:45  sofar

	* bin/lvu, sbin/lunar, var/lib/lunar/subroutines,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/edit.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/view.lunar: prune moved to lunar, moved
	code out of lvu.

2003-03-15 21:47  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: cosmetic fix for complete
	downloads.

2003-03-15 18:23  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/: subroutines, functions/depends.lunar,
	functions/download.lunar, functions/locking.lunar,
	functions/modules.lunar, functions/moonbase.lunar,
	functions/postbuild.lunar: Fixing all rm occurences.

2003-03-15 18:16  sofar

	* sbin/: lin, lrm, lunar: Fixing rm statements

2003-03-15 01:29  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/: subroutines, functions/download.lunar,
	functions/moonbase.lunar: New cvs handling code: uses SOURCE_URL
	and SOURCE. see gaim-cvs for example,note SOURCE_DIRECTORY becomes
	important. more vebosity and misc code cleanups elsewhere. Hope
	this works for everyone. Maybe tomorrow I'll look how this can be
	used for the xfce cvs modules, but this new scheme does not
	obliviate the old cvs handling code!!!

2003-03-13 05:03  nhudson

	* var/lib/lunar/sustained: 
	Ok this is a start of adding coreutils to Lunar.  I removed
	fileutils, sh-utils, and textutils and added in coreutils

2003-03-12 23:48  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/: subroutines, functions/download.lunar,
	functions/moonbase.lunar: get_moonbase is now in it's own file, and
	calls get_url to download, so any settings required are taken into
	consideration. Also added a little bit more verbosity info, and a
	*sub* version (hour after the dot) which is cosmetic only for
	logging purposes.

2003-03-08 22:40  dem

	* var/lib/lunar/excluded: This anoys the f*** out of me everytime
	it overwritters it
