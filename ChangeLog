	* bin/lvu: Elaine forgot to change 3 occations of mv_edit to
	mod_v_safe_edit

2003-10-01 16:28  elaine

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/: check.lunar, edit.lunar, install.lunar,
	modules.lunar, sizes.lunar, temp.lunar, tracking.lunar:
	install.lunar: fixed failure to correctly remove depends/module
	file rename mv_edit() routine mod_v_safe_edit()

2003-09-24 12:13  nhudson

	* var/lib/lunar/excluded: 
	Adding /etc/bonobo-activation and its file to excluded because it
	gets deleted when you remove evolution which is a very bad! thing!

2003-09-19 21:32  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/install.lunar: This fixes the double DL
	bug. see lunar for more info in commit msg

2003-09-17 00:36  elaine

	* bin/lvu, sbin/lget: lget - added -V |--Version syntax luv
	corrected 'versions' command oper.

2003-09-16 21:23  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/main.lunar: Bugfix #372

2003-09-15 14:58  nhudson

	* etc/lunar/mirrors/GNOME: 
	Updating Gnome mirror locations

2003-09-14 23:16  nhudson

	* var/lib/lunar/excluded: 
	Adding /etc/xml/docbook /etc/xml/catalog and /etc/sgml/catalog to
	the excluded list because sometimes they get deleted by
	scrollkeeper or libglade2

2003-09-12 02:11  elaine

	* usr/share/man/man8/lin.8: Added clarification to manual page -V
	version names must begin with [0-9]

2003-09-12 00:33  niki

	* sbin/lunar, var/lib/lunar/functions/main.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/menu/integrity.menu: Moved the rest of the
	depreciated "lin --fix" over to "lunar fix".

2003-09-11 16:03  tchan

	* sbin/lin: Corrected a spelling mistake.

2003-09-11 05:09  elaine

	* bin/lvu, sbin/lin, usr/share/man/man8/lin.8,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/check.lunar,

	var/lib/lunar/functions/tracking.lunar: Initial versioning support
	for lunar, where versions are either version-aware modules or
	subdirectories of the primary module.

2003-08-31 18:51  sofar

	* etc/lunar/config, etc/lunar/mirrors/LRESORT,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: Adding nl.lunar-linux.org
	to the mirror URL's, since it's rsynced hourly and can be used
	normally like the dk mirror. Also adding it to LRESORT as so we can
	drop the number of downloads from dbguin. Small fix for calls to
	LRESORT downloads, and starting to rephrase numeric statements to
	something that is unmistakenly numeric (( ... )).

2003-08-19 20:06  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/excluded: Adding /root/.distcc and resorting it
	alphabetically.

2003-08-16 19:54  elaine

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/postbuild.lunar: $IFS setting was causing
	variables to be improperly set for 'grep'

2003-08-16 17:04  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/compilers/: c++, cc, g++, gcc: Needed cos some
	developers insist on passing spaces around within #defines.

2003-08-14 21:27  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/: build.lunar, postbuild.lunar: yeah I
	know... looks like nothing... somehow this fixes all those init.d
	scripts hanging since a tee traces the fork to the daemon and waits
	before it exits... this should fix all 3 bugs on
	bugs.lunar-linux.org related to init.d scripts (I hope)

2003-08-14 20:25  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/install.lunar: re-enabling reports for
	succesfull resurrects, perhaps this needs a more elaborate rewrite,
	but it works for now. broken resurrects are not reported (as tchan
	says they werent in the past anyways).

2003-08-14 19:57  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/check.lunar: Disabling recompiles after
	"lunar fixdepends"

2003-08-14 19:41  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/: compilers/c++, compilers/cc, compilers/g++,
	compilers/gcc, functions/download.lunar, functions/optimize.lunar:
	this one fixes the appearing '1' file and also re-enables distcc
	(MAKES wasn't being set correctly due to this bug.) I'm also
	enabling DEBUG output in the wrapper scripts so you can see -pipe
	DOES WORK, you just don't see it ;^).

2003-08-11 02:22  elaine

	* var/lib/lunar/unset.sh: Scattershot, unset all variables not
	needed for external programs (e.g. ./configure; make; make install 
	 Usage: ( source /var/lib/lunar/unset.sh && ./configure [opts] )

2003-08-08 14:04  tchan

	* usr/share/man/man8/lget.8: Updating the size estimate of moonbase
	in the lget manpage.

2003-08-08 06:53  tchan

	* usr/share/man/man8/: lin.8, lunar.8: Updated man pages to match
	sofar's latest revisions.

2003-08-08 05:59  tchan

	* usr/share/man/man8/lunar.8: Updated man page for lunar with
	sofar's latest version.

2003-08-08 05:39  tchan

	* usr/share/man/man8/lget.8: Updated the man page for lget, upto
	sofar's latest version.

2003-08-08 05:16  tchan

	* usr/share/man/man8/lfirsttime.8: Added the reference to the man
	page for lnet.

2003-08-08 05:13  tchan

	* usr/share/man/man8/lcrash.8: Updated lcrash man page.

2003-08-08 05:10  tchan

	latest revisions.

2003-08-08 04:44  tchan

	* usr/share/man/man1/moonbase.1: Updated the man page for moonbase.

2003-08-08 04:37  tchan

	* usr/share/man/man1/lvu.1: Updated the lvu man page to reflect
	sofar's latest changes.

2003-08-08 04:16  tchan

	* bin/lvu: Corrected some more typos in help() function.

2003-08-08 03:59  tchan

	* bin/lvu: Added some fixes to the help() function for lvu. 
	Brought it upto date with sofar's latest standardized command line
	options.

2003-08-07 23:52  sofar

	* sbin/lin, var/lib/lunar/functions/install.lunar: fix as of
	request tchan: $BUILD was unset during resurrect, and hooking up
	the code in lunar. Both approaches (lin -R or lunar resurrect)
	tested thorougly.

2003-08-07 18:01  sofar

	* sbin/lin: Muchos gracias a tchan.

2003-08-07 16:12  sofar

	* sbin/lin: Slightly goofed up lin --deps code handling...

2003-08-07 10:29  sofar

	* usr/share/man/man8/lfirsttime.8: small adjustments

2003-08-07 10:21  sofar

	* usr/share/man/man8/lcrash.8: Updating this page to make it a bit
	more recent.

2003-08-07 09:48  sofar

	* bin/lvu, sbin/lunar, var/lib/lunar/functions/check.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/install.lunar: Adding uniform parameter
	passing to lvu, fixing up lvu urls to ignore testpack() and
	connect(), hooking up --help to lunar, also making it call the
	proper fix/nofix/fixdepends code. Last merged fixing code into
	check.lunar, so this is all together in one file and not in
	install.lunar.

2003-08-07 07:35  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Reverted tchans patch
	since that killed the optimizations on compile. Adding a line where
	the optimizations are read just before the menu's are run, so we're
	all happy now.

2003-08-07 05:56  tchan

	* sbin/: lget, lin, lrm, lunar: Added/corrected help() function
	text in all four coretools.  Still needs work by sofar.

2003-08-07 04:24  tchan

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Fixed the bug in theedge
	of "lunar optimize" not loading up the settings from
	/etc/lunar/local/optimizations.  sofar had moved the sourcing of
	the optimizations file into the optimize() which is too late.  I
	moved it to the top of the optimize_architecture().  Older code
	just had the sourcing of optimizations at the top of optimize.lunar
	script.

2003-08-06 23:12  sofar

	* sbin/: lget, lin, lrm, lunar: Uniformizing parameter passing
	using getopt, making this a LOT simpler, cleaner and simply pwetty.
	
	QOTD: The man who understands one woman is qualified to understand
	pretty well everything. 		 -- Yeats

2003-08-06 21:53  tchan

	* usr/share/man/man8/lfirsttime.8: Small update.  Removed the
	install perl instructions.  Perl has been part of the Lunar ISO for
	quite some time now.

2003-08-06 01:31  niki

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/install.lunar: Added a missing space in a
	message.
