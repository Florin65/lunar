	* var/lib/lunar/: subroutines, functions/optimize.lunar: Added 2 new subroutines (bad_flags and patch_it):
	
	  bad_flags is a subroutine to remove any known bad flags on a per module basis, this effects system CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, and CPPFLAGS as well as optimizations chosen in lunar.  It is to be used as follows:
	
	    bad_flags <list of bad CFLAGS and LDFLAGS>
	
	      Example:
	      bad_flags -ffast-math -funroll-loops -s
	
	    Or to remove ALL optimizations use:
	      bad_flags ALL (Case matters!)
	
	  patch_it is a subroutine to create a generic patching interface for lunar modules it is to be used as follows:
	
	    patch_it <patch location/patch name> <patch level>
	
	      Example:
	        patch_it $SOURCE_CACHE/4.2.0-4.2.1.diff.gz 1
	
	Added more support for KEEP_SOURCE options into default_prebuild.

	* sbin/: lin, lunar: Hacked in $KEEP_SOURCE into lunar menu and fixed lin to use $KEEP_SOURCE.
	This allows sysadmin to tell "lin" to keep the source code in /usr/src and
	as opposed to the default behavior of removing source code on successful
	builds.

	* var/lib/lunar/: functions/optimize.lunar, menu/optimize.menu: Updating optimizations:
	  Added C warnings options:
	    -Wno-deprecated
	
	  Added C++ warnings options:
	    -Wno-deprecated
	
	  Added Speed options:
	    -fexpensive-optimizations
	    -falign-double
	
	  Added framework for Stack optimization/manipulation, this can be different for each platform. Currently only the x86 is supported (-mpreferred-stack-boundary) but should allow others to be added easily.
