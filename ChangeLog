	* bin/lvu, sbin/lin, sbin/lrm, sbin/lunar, usr/sbin/colony,
	var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Generalizing code: less is now replaced with view_file(), which also handles
	stdin of course. It also will use the $PAGER env variable for those who
	want to override it with their default pager. Small effort, big gain.
