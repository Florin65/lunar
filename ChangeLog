2004-05-19 10:04  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/moonbase.lunar: make 'moonbase'
	'hold'-able =^D (nice for those rebuilds)

2004-05-11 16:09  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: Bad is when this file is
	missing and it never gets created...

2004-05-10 15:31  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/check.lunar: This is a fix for 'lunar
	fix' looping on clean installs: <sofar|work> yeah I did some chroot
	crunching ;^) <sofar|work> on a clean ISO <sofar|work> there's
	md5sum mismatches in glibc's libxxx.a files that trigger it
	<sofar|work> then ENV var pollution makes the wrong files
	rebuild... you get the rest

2004-05-10 11:46  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/recovery.lunar: This way recovery even
	recovers the approximate install date. I've tested this on many
	boxes now and it's absolutely wonderfull. Considering putting this
	in the lunar maintenance menu so people can use it (although it's
	still mopping up after some other part goofs up)

2004-05-09 12:08  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/: depends.lunar, main.lunar,
	messages.lunar, modules.lunar, prune.lunar, recovery.lunar: Some
	bugfixes regarding locking, ordering of locks and return status of
	locking, some fixes with missing depends (important one), visual
	adjustment of titlebar display (compile instead of processing,
	added hostname, $0[$$]).

2004-05-02 09:32  striker

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/: download.lunar, main.lunar,
	recovery.lunar: s/successfull/successful/ Spellchecker anyone? ;)

2004-04-27 07:12  sofar

	* etc/lunar/mirrors/GNOME: These files are TAB separated now.

2004-04-26 18:22  nhudson

	* etc/lunar/mirrors/GNOME: 
	Adding a http master site for GNOME, this may help those who cant
	get to a ftp server

2004-04-26 14:47  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/check.lunar: fi

2004-04-26 10:02  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/check.lunar: Fixing run_fix: it would fix
	only held modules. Also cleaned up quite a bit.

2004-04-24 19:08  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/main.lunar: Env var pollution pro bono,
	get your env var pollution!!!

2004-04-24 15:45  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/main.lunar: Moe: I really don't like the
	workaround you used for the download procedure .. theedge is
	lget'ed twice f.e. [FIXED]

2004-04-17 16:33  sofar

	* sbin/lin: thx for spotting this nick

2004-04-17 16:02  sofar

	* sbin/lin: Adding a trap that cleans up /tmp/lunar.lin.* and also
	removes the known temporary files. This works like a charm in
	cleaning up threads on cancelled or breaking compiles. Hopefully
	this catches and cleans up on a lot of bad things now.

2004-04-16 10:57  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/main.lunar: Add this back: last minute
	source code presence check before compile starts.

2004-04-16 10:37  sofar

	* bin/lvu: Merging vertigo's patch suggestion and taking a bit of
	time to rewrite those two secionts of code.

2004-04-16 10:18  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Don't even try to check if
	we can't update them anyway...

2004-04-16 10:15  sofar

	* sbin/lin: Adding adjustment suggested by jazman

2004-04-11 21:54  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/: depends.lunar, modules.lunar: Fix for
	normal users seeing garbage when the call lunar's core tools with
	garbage. should clean up stuff a bit.

2004-04-08 13:53  prox

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/config.lunar: changed sed to cover
	substrings

2004-04-08 13:25  prox

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/config.lunar: fixed issue with list of
	initscript being return with quotes

2004-03-30 20:52  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: Prevent RECONFIGURE from
	propagating.

2004-03-30 12:56  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/menu/optimize.menu: Thanks Victor.

2004-03-29 22:24  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: This is a bit more
	experimental patch: - ask for a confirmation before removing a
	conflicting module (break if no) - added opt_dep bypass in case
	there is no need to ask the user since he really has no choice
	anyway.

2004-03-29 21:14  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/postbuild.lunar: Make garbage *not*
	install doc/Makefile directories!!!

2004-03-29 20:58  sofar

	* etc/lunar/mirrors/GNOME: quotes, ugly. tab separation works now,
	much nicer

2004-03-29 15:18  sofar

	* sbin/lrm: Adding REAP back, somehow it had disappeared.

2004-03-26 19:40  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/menu/mirrors.menu: Explicitly split by tabs and
	break up options, also reversing the order per element. (#462)

2004-03-24 12:33  sofar

	* etc/lunar/config, var/lib/lunar/functions/build.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: * Adding preliminary _PREFIX
	work (works!) * Fixing mosrun caller to check for openmosix-tools
	instead of linux-openmosix.
