	var/lib/lunar/functions/sources.lunar: <sofar> I have a bugfix for
	the core here <sofar> it involves -r being confused with --deps
	<sofar> something broke in the core about 3/4 months back <sofar> I
	just found it and fixed the problem, commit to lunar will follow
	shortly <sofar> e.g. do a lin -r lunar.... you'll see 5 lunar
	questions but 20+ unwanted ones <sofar> that is a BUG, and never
	was intentional.  <sofar> I also have changed lget behaviour,
	defaults to NOT download anything, and downloads everything with
	lget --all <sofar> lemme see what else is in theere <sofar> one
	cosmetic bug fix regarding download log <sofar> lunar exile XXX can
	now also be called if a module is NOT installed <sofar> FUZZY
	downloads now default to OFF <sofar> and gpg: syntax has changed a
	bit
