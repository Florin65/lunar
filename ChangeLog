	obsolete -mcpu into -mtune.

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/edit.lunar: Allow patches to be searched
	in $(PWD) && $SOURCE_CACHE, so you never have to explicitly specify
	the location. uniform calling as with unpack() now.

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/postbuild.lunar: Same permissions but

	* bin/lvu: Proper directory handling that allows both passing
	absolute and relative filenames of the snapshot.

2004-05-24 13:12  sofar

	* bin/lvu: Fixing export/import scripts. It now includes a copy of
	'packages' and sorts the queue according to dependency as well,
	which should make things easier (note some things still don't work
	that way correctly).
