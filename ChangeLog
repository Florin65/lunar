	* sbin/lin, sbin/lunar, var/lib/lunar/excluded,
	var/lib/lunar/subroutines, var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Major code update, including VERBOSE flag (default off, cos lin is still noisy), lots and lots of core rewrites, optimizations, formatting and spacing, removal of old and unused code, etc.

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Adding --keepconfig in here to get lunar renew working again, see lrm commit.

	* sbin/lin: adding --keepconfig so config files stay untouched.
	
2003-02-05 23:52  sofar

	* sbin/lrm: First couple of fixes:
	
	* no bailout when no DETAILS found (lrm should be possible afterall the install log is there)
	* add --keepconfig in order prepare_install functions normally
	* missing md5sum should PRESERVE config files just in case, as we know lunar already makes good md5sums, and in case that feature is off bad things go happen
	* updated help.
	
	TODO:
	
	- add regex support for excluded/protected like /etc/.*\.conf
	- speed profile removal queue processing: it is *SLOW*, consider reimporting old lrm routine which constructs a large grep statement (hazardous: command line chars are expensive and bash can only handle so much)
	- test
