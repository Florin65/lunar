	all regular files in that directory before BUILD/default_build.

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Bringing some of the added
	functionality from theedge back into lunar core.  Specifically the
	patch_it function which is appearing in more of moonbase.  Also
	added the fixes from theedge for the disappearing
	/usr/share/info/dir file.  Added the timestamp feature in the
	activity_log from theedge.

	* lib/lsb/init-functions: Fix pgrep so it only finds processes that
	start with PROCESS.  It was previously finding any process which
	contained PROCESS, so kapmd was found when apmd was the process
	being searched for.

	code
