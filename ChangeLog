	* sbin/lrm: adding debug_msg to lrm, stumbling on a bug that caused
	directories not being removed...

2003-07-27 23:05  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/: build.lunar, download.lunar,
	install.lunar, messages.lunar, temp.lunar: adding debugging code,
	to use do: DEBUG=on lin $MODULE (or any other lunar core program)

2003-07-27 21:33  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/sources.lunar: Try this:
	
	gpg_verify_source /var/spool/lunar/sendmail.8.12.9.tar.gz
	http://www.sendmail.org/ftp/sendmail.8.12.9.tar.gz.sig

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/install.lunar: Polishing up resurrect:
	
	- it is now "autoresurrect" - lunar resurrect $MODULE is the way to
	force a resurrect - resurrect is skipped with -c - resurrect is
	skipped when the module is already installed, because	we rather
	want a recompile then to make sure...
	
	this should be the end of the resurrect rewrite.

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: one more try....

2003-07-24 21:40  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: trying again!

2003-07-24 21:28  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: Some CVS handling code
	cleanups that revealed problems... perhaps this solves Moe's
	issues.

2003-07-23 22:54  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/: build.lunar, install.lunar,
	sources.lunar: Fixing a bug that niki spotted, propagation of error
	result now comes from missing downloads down to lin_module, which
	exists before optimize now too. General order in pre-build stage
	improved too. Moving verify_source code out of build into
	sources.lunar.

2003-07-22 21:01  sofar

	* sbin/lin, var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar,

2003-07-20 16:52  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: Fixes for the SVN urls,
	symplifying svn and cvs ups.

2003-07-20 15:35  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/connect.lunar: since these 2 are a royal
	pain in the ass I decided to kick them into their own
	forget-me-file.

2003-07-20 15:34  sofar

	* bin/lvu, var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: Fixing lvu
	search bug, adding full support for svn:// urls, see moonbase/zbeta
	dor 2 example modules that use svn:// URL's.

2003-07-18 03:08  tchan

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Again, fixed the typo of
	"PLATFOM" to be "PLATFORM".  This was fixed in a previous version
	of this code but was LOST in sofar's latest merge.

2003-07-17 23:31  csm

	* bin/lvu: fixing a typo. "ist_section" is not the same as
	"list_section"

2003-07-17 22:28  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: Error out when a
	dependency is exiled with a proper message.

2003-07-17 20:43  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/: download.lunar, edit.lunar,
	install.lunar, sources.lunar, useradd.lunar: Fixed some error
	messages (trying to uniformize them) and a fix for a broken
	download (unpack() croaking) error that resulted in unpack not
	logging the broken lin to activity log.

2003-07-17 20:19  sofar

	* bin/lvu, sbin/lin, var/lib/lunar/functions/build.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/install.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/uniqid.lunar: Some minor cosmetic fixes,
	run_details used better, especially in lvu, fixed a hang on
	use_initd. Moved conflicts() to depends.lunar, changed ID so the
	output of the wget command gets echoed to stdout (so we possibly
	can send out a motd).

2003-07-17 14:50  tchan

	* usr/share/man/man8/lunar.8: Added spaces to the optional
	parameters listing to make it format and read much better.

	needed.

2003-07-13 21:57  sofar

	Hi,
	
	this is not a mailbox flood, but rather something I've been working
	on for about 3.4 weeks now. Some fundamental things have changed in
	the code and from the outside not much may have changed, but this
	is a 2400 line merge!
	
	Biggest differences is in the function calling and temporary file
	generation, which now has a complete unique ID and gets cleaned up
	better. All major functions have been rewritten to handle $@ and
	return data over STDOUT.
	
	Upgrading and installing multiple modules has been rewritten, all
	frontends are now true frontends (no standard code in there
	anymore).
	
	I added some gadgets for CVS options thanks to jol, and there's a
	framework for downloading code from SVN:// urls, which I haven't
	been able to check yet... someone please try.
	
	some gaps still remain, this *IS* theedge. I suspect resurrect
	behaviour to be broken, as well as the download monitoring (but at
	least it works). At least I'll be able to track most of the bugs
	now pretty fast, as I know where there still is more work to do...
	
	Noted also that md5sum checking was down in theedge up to this one,
	as for quite some few other bugs... should be all fixed I hope.
	
	Please make sure that you run the theedge code for testing, I
	really need the feedback on this in the coming 2 weeks.
	
	Thanks,
	
	sofar
