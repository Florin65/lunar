	* var/lib/lunar/functions/install.lunar: Call lrm when doing an
	explicit resurrect! (overwriting is not bad per se, but this is
	more decent)

2003-12-28 14:35  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/: build.lunar, connect.lunar,
	install.lunar, sources.lunar: Cleanups and some slight adjustments
	towards CPAN code, md5sum checkings.

2003-12-22 18:33  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/check.lunar: minor adjustment to make it
	more resistant against my imagination.

2003-12-22 18:21  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/check.lunar: Fixing lunar "fixdepends"
	code, much more slick now... will need to be tested before merging
	down to lunar though.

2003-12-22 17:31  sofar

	* bin/lvu: Fixed up lvu voyeur... it works now again!!! (note it's
	a bit crude but quite effective at finding the right compile log
	file, it should work for everyone)

2003-12-13 20:58  elaine

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/check.lunar: Fixed another /versioning
	bug, we still have dup lines in the fixdepends- created depends
	files

	variables sothat enviro_check won't complain during iso/install

2003-12-09 20:03  hardkrash

	grease

2003-12-05 10:56  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/moonbase.lunar: Adding more proper
	handling of moonbase: - create md5sum log (just for kicks, not
	really used) - proper install log - call lrm to clean up install
	and md5sum logs on new update

2003-11-26 20:52  sofar

	* bin/lvu, var/lib/lunar/functions/build.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: lvu eert fix, adding
	prototype cpan module handling (ugly, yes)

2003-11-26 16:59  tchan

	* var/state/lunar/: blacklist.Alpha, blacklist.PowerPC,
	blacklist.SPARC: Added uml to the blacklist.  Its an x86 module
	ONLY.

2003-11-25 23:22  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/uniqid.lunar: Fixes moonbase downloads
	time-outing if dbguin is down... we prolly have to merge this into
	lunar ASAP.

2003-11-19 01:20  elaine

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Providing for ARCH
	specific script files *note* all x86 = <SCRIPT>.i386

2003-11-16 00:19  hardkrash

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/: install.lunar, messages.lunar: added
	xterm status messages

2003-11-15 14:52  elaine

	formatting again

2003-11-14 17:37  tchan

	* var/state/lunar/: blacklist.Alpha, blacklist.PowerPC,
	blacklist.SPARC: The current module for uClibc will only compile on
	x86.  uClibc does support other architectures, but the Lunar module
	is currently setup for x86 ONLY!

2003-11-11 18:39  elaine

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/install.lunar: Always keep a copy of the
	scripts used to create a module. This is intended to be useful for
	general backtracking, debugging and to provide an adjunct to the
	activity file to know what's been done without resorting to cvs
	history.
	
	Also safeguards local development work for devs who overwrite their
	work with 'lin moonbase' and the like (and yes this is the *real*
	reason for adding this little hack).
	
	Adding this to post_install because at this point we know that we
	have a successful install (logs and everything have in theory been
	created by the time we get here.

2003-11-09 15:18  sofar

	* bin/lvu: lvu tree fix. thanks lurch!

2003-11-09 14:49  sofar

	var/lib/lunar/compilers/gcc, var/lib/lunar/functions/install.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/main.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/moonbase.lunar: Syncing some fixes:
	
	 - compiler wrappers showed wrong compile call
	 - get_moonbase breakage detection
	 - cpan:// module installing native supported (need to commit
	example modules, please be patient)
	 - autoresurrect logging disabled (too much noise in logs,
	especially with sound on).

2003-11-02 15:27  elaine

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: Minor tweak to prompt,
	split to 2 lines, should now fit 80col.
