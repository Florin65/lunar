	* var/lib/lunar/functions/sources.lunar: Adding sha1: verify syntax
	code that uses sha1sum, slightly better than md5sum (what is it
	again, 160 bits against 128 hash size?). The code hooks up
	seamlessly and as demonstrated the older core doesn't break if it
	doesn't handle the sha1: syntax. sha1sum is provided by coreutils
	BTW so must in any case be present on all boxes, I don't expect any
	box to fail on that.

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Slightly modified after
	ranitha's optimize patch for gcc-3.4.x. This will transform the
	obsolete -mcpu into -mtune.

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/edit.lunar: Allow patches to be searched
	in $(PWD) && $SOURCE_CACHE, so you never have to explicitly specify
	the location. uniform calling as with unpack() now.
