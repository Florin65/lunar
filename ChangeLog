	* bin/lvu, var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/misc.lunar: few simple download fixes.

2003-04-28 18:57  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/moonbase.lunar: fix for old
	moonbase.tar.bz2 flying around in /tmp (we really need to move
	everything out of /tmp), and better consistent install log creation
	(with neat trick)

2003-04-27 23:13  sofar

	* sbin/lin, var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: narrowing this
	down to the absolute minimum, making the code much more simple.

2003-04-27 17:24  sofar

	* bin/lvu, etc/lunar/config, sbin/lget, sbin/lin, sbin/lrm,

	var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/sources.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/tracking.lunar: Huge sunday cleanup: -
	removed subroutines, moving stuff around to .lunar function files,
	updating all core programs, uniformizing them as well.

2003-04-26 22:53  sofar

	* sbin/lin: 10 points for tchan

2003-04-24 21:25  sofar

	* etc/lunar/config: Geez that's a horrible one...

2003-04-24 09:18  sofar

	* bin/lvu: removing referral to media/marbleblabla.jpg since it's
	nonexistant.

2003-04-24 07:25  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: Better put it in here
	too...

2003-04-23 21:19  sofar

	* etc/lunar/config: Adding all safe lunar mirrors as MOONBASE_URL,
	this allows dk.lunar-linux to take over in case the main site is
	unreachable. (go niki!)

2003-04-23 20:25  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/check.lunar: errr, forgot to check this
	one in.

2003-04-23 19:54  sofar

	* bin/lvu, sbin/lin, var/lib/lunar/subroutines,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/messages.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: more spring cleaning!
	check_functions are now callable from lsh

2003-04-22 21:37  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Prevent moonbase to be tagged for
	removal on a lunar update.

2003-04-22 15:32  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/moonbase.lunar: Atomizing get_moonbase,
	making use of download_module etc. Adding support for install log
	too, as well as updating the installed list.

2003-04-22 12:08  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/messages.lunar: small nitpicking in ayle
	6

2003-04-22 11:01  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/: subroutines, functions/prune.lunar: Moving prune
	code out, several cosmetic and non-cosmetic prune fixes. Prune code
	seems okay here. (slow but correct behaviour)

2003-04-21 17:48  sofar

	* bin/lvu: Fixes, adding support to check out URL's from a module
	(or all!)

2003-04-18 19:44  sofar

	* bin/lvu, sbin/lunar, usr/share/man/man1/lvu.1,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: w00t w00t, found some time
	to add "lvu held" , "lunar [hold|unhold] xxx", also added shortcuts
	for "lunar [install|remove] xxxx".

2003-04-12 19:52  sofar

	* usr/share/man/man1/lvu.1: updating this.

2003-04-12 19:44  sofar

	* bin/lvu: adding an option that allows you to look against which
	modules a binary from another module is linked. Usage: lvu links
	MODULE

2003-04-12 16:12  sofar

	* sbin/lrm, var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: lrm fixes,
	removing TEST slowly, cosmetic fix in the fixdepends code

2003-04-07 20:51  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/: subroutines, functions/download.lunar,
	functions/edit.lunar, functions/messages.lunar,
	functions/optimize.lunar, functions/postbuild.lunar,
	functions/sources.lunar: Small cleanups, verbosity output uniformed

2003-04-06 22:47  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/: depends.lunar, edit.lunar: bugfix #273,
	also minor code cleanups

2003-04-01 23:11  sofar

	* lib/lsb/init-functions: This looks at the PID file rather than in
	the process table, much more decent, no whining about PID's.
	Cleaned up some bad code. Reformatted, sprinkled with cheese too.

2003-04-01 22:25  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: wheps

2003-04-01 22:24  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/: subroutines, functions/messages.lunar,
	functions/modules.lunar, functions/optimize.lunar,
	functions/sources.lunar: More moves, committing them in theedge
	only for now....

2003-04-01 18:33  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: BAH

2003-04-01 18:25  wizfactor

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Fixed typo

2003-03-31 20:32  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: Did not spot this typo
	before...

2003-03-30 20:45  sofar

	* usr/share/man/: man1/lvu.1, man8/lunar.8: updating these man
	pages!

2003-03-29 23:41  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: Better handling of
	depends: avoid unnecesary messages and edits

2003-03-27 17:41  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/updatelog.lunar: These 2 got left out...

2003-03-26 08:46  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/protected: adding dirname, since an update of
	coreutils shows lrm cannot find it.

2003-03-25 22:25  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/menu/dmodule.menu: Merging back niki's typo fix
	reported by Moe.

2003-03-24 20:55  kc8apf

	* var/lib/lunar/menu/optimize.menu: Stupid bug #2

2003-03-24 19:19  kc8apf

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Stupid mistake

2003-03-24 16:21  kc8apf

	* var/lib/lunar/: functions/optimize.lunar, menu/optimize.menu:
	Clean up options for Alpha CPUs

2003-03-24 08:20  sofar

	* sbin/lin: wheps

2003-03-24 00:22  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: BIG BIG BIG bugfix: lunar
	will now better find moved modules (umm, I say better, but I mean
	actually that lunar now actually finds them. I dunno what is better
	than that, so yeah, better).

2003-03-24 00:13  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: muuuuuch better

2003-03-23 23:43  sofar

	* sbin/lget, sbin/lin, var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/postbuild.lunar: deprecated use_cvs and the
	CVS_MODULE scheme, CVS is now 100% transparent. Hope to merge these
	changes into lunar soon.

2003-03-23 14:28  sofar

	* sbin/lin: typo

2003-03-20 00:04  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/updatelog.lunar: BEER for kongar!!!

2003-03-18 20:38  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: CVS code now handles cvs
	modules with paths (xfce-devel/xxx) and truncates the path from the
	tarball. This enables the xfce-cvs modules to be rewritten using
	the new cvs source scheme.

2003-03-17 23:56  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: misc cosmetic fix.

2003-03-16 22:23  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: bugfix: always write the
	proper tar file.

2003-03-16 21:47  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: New default_cvs_* functions to call
	autogen.sh

2003-03-16 20:59  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/: functions/download.lunar, menu/download.menu:
	adding fix for bad cvs tarfile, and introducing a cvs ipdate
	threshold, to make sure you don't hammer a cvs server (defaults to
	10 minutes)

2003-03-16 20:25  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: This seems needed. I'll keep it in
	here for a while.

2003-03-16 17:45  sofar

	* bin/lvu, sbin/lunar, var/lib/lunar/subroutines,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/edit.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/view.lunar: prune moved to lunar, moved
	code out of lvu.

2003-03-15 21:47  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: cosmetic fix for complete
	downloads.

2003-03-15 18:23  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/: subroutines, functions/depends.lunar,
	functions/download.lunar, functions/locking.lunar,
	functions/modules.lunar, functions/moonbase.lunar,
	functions/postbuild.lunar: Fixing all rm occurences.

2003-03-15 18:16  sofar

	* sbin/: lin, lrm, lunar: Fixing rm statements

2003-03-15 01:29  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/: subroutines, functions/download.lunar,
	functions/moonbase.lunar: New cvs handling code: uses SOURCE_URL
	and SOURCE. see gaim-cvs for example,note SOURCE_DIRECTORY becomes
	important. more vebosity and misc code cleanups elsewhere. Hope
	this works for everyone. Maybe tomorrow I'll look how this can be
	used for the xfce cvs modules, but this new scheme does not
	obliviate the old cvs handling code!!!

2003-03-13 05:03  nhudson

	* var/lib/lunar/sustained: 
	Ok this is a start of adding coreutils to Lunar.  I removed
	fileutils, sh-utils, and textutils and added in coreutils
