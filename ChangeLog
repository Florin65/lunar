	* lunar/trunk/bin/lvu: whitespace

2006-12-22 22:28  v3rt1g0

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/check.lunar: * I didn't feel
	  that lunar _nofix_ should run though the list of modules twice.
	  First to get the list of broken and second time, to do all the
	  work again, but just on the broken ones. So I relocated the
	  conditional that checked for NOFIX from inside the fix loop to
	  outside the loop all together * I also changed it so that the
	  final "log" that gets printed out differentiates between 'fix' and
	  'nofix' * In the svn diff, it looks like a lot changed, but that's
	  only because I had to indent things one level deeper to be
	  consistent in format, the changes were actually really small.

2006-12-06 16:56  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/aliases.lunar: Allow the user
	  to press [ENTER] when provided with aliases, which will
	  automatically pick alias #1, and we'll order the moonbase/aliases
	  such that those provide the recommended order.

2006-12-02 05:39  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/bin/lvu: remove trailing whitespace and have lvu alien
	  throw it's first three messages tooooo stderr instead of stdout

2006-12-02 05:39  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Bugfix: allow
	  DETAILS.x86_64, but broken for using lin -w on DETAILS for other
	  archs. Hey, it fixes a big problem ;)

2006-12-01 17:30  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: Add some color
	  to the dependency checker, remove double space, colorize modules
	  in one color only

2006-11-10 15:45  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/protected: add more to protected

2006-11-08 22:54  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/protected: More havoc during upgrades.

2006-11-05 22:10  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/tracking.lunar: Lurch knows
	  best.

2006-11-05 21:50  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/tracking.lunar: Make sure we
	  split by lines here - fixes md5sum creation for filenames with
	  spaces.

2006-11-05 21:38  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/messages.lunar: Fix alias code
	  bug when VERBOSE=on. Minor cleanups and speedups.

2006-11-01 23:23  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/useradd.lunar: Adding
	  add_priv_group $GROUP subfunction to allow creation of a group
	  only

2006-11-01 02:51  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/moonbase.lunar,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/plugins.lunar,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/tracking.lunar: Speed
	  improvements suggested by Lurch: shaves down a `lin moonbase` from
	  39s to 9s.

2006-10-31 17:33  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: depends cache
	  speedup: before 5.2s, after 0.8s (warm cache). Lurch: ty :)

2006-10-31 15:46  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: Wheps.

2006-10-27 17:26  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: [FIX] make sure
	  alias doesn't loop find_depends was using a stdin | read loop
	  which breaks anything in that context that might read from user
	  input. We take a small performance hit by not using the smart awk
	  call but instead split up the STATE lookup which is not executed
	  for each round. All in all this should perform the same as the old
	  code. some small whitespace fixes here too.

2006-10-26 16:16  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/aliases.lunar: [PATCH] new
	  alias code This new alias algorithm stores the users' choice when
	  asked for %X as LUNAR_ALIAS_X in the local config. This speeds up
	  lookups later and eliminates the need to detect aliases on the
	  fly. We can delete all the detection code and the user will only
	  once ever get asked. unsetting an alias choice is as easy as
	  `lunar unset LUANR_ALIAS_X`

2006-10-26 15:17  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/build.lunar: allow modules to
	  tag themselves as PROFILE=yes modules skipping warnings when it
	  does not install files

2006-10-13 14:35  elangelo

	* lunar/trunk/etc/lunar/config, lunar/trunk/etc/lunar/mirrors/XORG,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/menu/mirrors.menu,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/unset.sh: adding XORG_URL to
	  lunar/theedge gr,S.

2006-09-29 14:56  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/misc.lunar: moo

2006-09-23 17:37  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/plugins/download-generic.plugin: Allow
	  https:// urls to bypass certificate check, clean up the code a
	  bit.

2006-09-21 03:33  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/misc.lunar: helper function
	  strips off .tar.bz2 or .tar.gz

2006-07-15 20:51  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/plugins/initd.plugin: Allow SA to skip
	  restarting of services with `lunar set LUNAR_RESTART_SERVICES off`

2006-07-15 19:24  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Updated
	  find_section, we were not scanning zlocal if
	  ZLOCAL_OVERRIDES==off. bug #120.

2006-07-15 17:55  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/plugins/postbuild-generic.plugin:
	  gather_docs fix - only the PLUGIN needs to de/in-voke
	  installwatch. the plain 'gather_docs' command can skip calling it.
	  This fixes reports of alienated files that were installed from
	  BUILD after a call to `gather_docs`.

2006-06-19 14:55  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: Fix cvs
	  downloading by not appending '/'.

2006-05-31 15:39  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Fixing up some
	  semi-broken core functions to spot sections and modules properly
	  inside zlocal/...

2006-05-27 16:34  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Bugfix: "xenos"
	  found this one and repro'd it in a way that it was easily found.
	  good work.

2006-05-11 15:28  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Explicitly set
	  PKG_CONFIG_PATH and PATH for non-standard build locations. Makes
	  setting PKT_CONFIG_PATH in BUILD obsolete.

2006-05-10 22:26  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/bin/lvu: Must have fixed this 3x already and never got
	  it right - this finally fixes lvu diff the proper way.

2006-05-08 16:08  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/bin/lvu: fix lvu stree on zlocal modules

2006-04-24 04:20  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Fix for #86 -
	  do not store zlocal modules in the module.index file. this will
	  cause zlocal modules not to show up in tabcompletion but closes
	  some nuisances with double returns from find_section($MODULE).

2006-04-19 17:30  moe

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: Fixes a bug
	  that made verbose_msg show a invalid download url. Had no effect
	  on the real download process though.

2006-04-17 17:07  moe

	* lunar/trunk/etc/lunar/mirrors/GNU: Fix wrong urls. They brake
	  lget.

2006-04-09 19:01  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/check.lunar,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/plugins/check-ldd.plugin: fix ldd-check
	  by making the run_details only used inside run_checks() - all
	  other code can now not be contaminated with polluted vars.

2006-03-30 04:38  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Remember where
	  the cursor was in this menu - makes it less clunky navigating.

2006-03-29 02:29  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/sbin/lrm: As noted by tchan, POST_REMOVE needs to be
	  run AFTER a module has been succesfully removed. This means that
	  administrativa must have finished. BUGFIX #75.

2006-03-29 02:13  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: Bugfix for #74
	  - remove any double backslash at the end of an URL before
	  continuing.

2006-03-27 17:32  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/main.lunar: BUGFIX: run_fix
	  was never called before a rebuild

2006-03-27 01:11  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/misc.lunar: whitespace and
	  debugging output fixes

2006-03-22 19:12  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/ChangeLog: Updated.

2006-03-22 17:44  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/c++,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/cc,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/g++,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/gcc,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/ld: New wrappers. Neutered
	  from COPTS CCOPTS CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS.

2006-03-22 17:27  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/plugins/optimize-wrappers.plugin:
	  BUGFIX: wrappers were always enabled basically - ovverriding it
	  globally or from DETAILS never worked.

2006-03-21 19:10  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/bin/lvu, lunar/trunk/etc/lunar/config,
	  lunar/trunk/sbin/lunar,
	  lunar/trunk/usr/share/doc/lunar/core-documentation/etc_lunar_config.html,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar,

	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/menu/download.menu,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/plugins/download-generic.plugin,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/unset.sh: Do not use := but preferably
	  :- since it is safer (doesn't modify the defaulted var). Also wipe
	  GCCWRAPPERS from all references.

2006-03-21 16:06  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/ld: Reverting this since it
	  breaks a tonload of compiles (and generally makes people unhappy).

2006-03-17 04:30  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/cc,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/g++,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/gcc,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/ld,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/make: Most needed fix - add ""
	  around $@ in the wrappers.

2006-03-14 05:20  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/plugins/optimize-wrappers.plugin: label
	  change to make this intuitive.

2006-03-14 05:15  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/c++,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/cc,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/g++,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/gcc,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/ld,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/make: Force CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS
	  when calling cc/c++. Force LDFLAGS (with -Wl, part stripped) when
	  calling ld. This works and should strip more programs, compile
	  more with chosen optimizations. You may notice some flags passed
	  twice to programs, but I consider this cosmetic and not harmful.

2006-03-08 06:23  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/protected: indeed, typo

2006-03-08 06:11  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/protected: Just making really sure that
	  'basename' and 'cut' don't get deleted.

2006-03-08 05:44  ratler

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/c++,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/cc,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/g++,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/gcc,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/ld,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/make,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/plugins.lunar: This fixes bug
	  http://bugs.lunar-linux.org/view.php?id=71 In short during prepare
	  install stage of coreutils, plugin and wrappers expected to find
	  cut and basename which are part of coreutils. Those tools have
	  been replaced with bash equivalent code.

2006-03-06 05:38  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/misc.lunar: Making this
	  algorithm a bit more agressive - compress all xxx.n files with
	  gzip.

2006-03-05 21:42  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/check.lunar,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/updatelog.lunar: Allow 'lunar
	  fix' to display a report whether fixes were succesfull or not.

2006-03-05 20:05  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/etc/lunar/mirrors/LRESORT: bugfix: someone nuked
	  spaces/tabs - also added be and fr-de.

2006-03-05 06:58  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/bin/lvu: Add a compile time calculator to 'lvu info' -
	  it will use TimeDate - and display that this perl module is
	  missing.

2006-03-03 18:00  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: cosmetic - add
	  source file to verbose_msg

2006-03-02 22:12  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/c++,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/cc,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/g++,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/gcc,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/ld,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/make: New wrappers: these
	  actually do some smart tinkering and call the non-wrapped version
	  of $0 properly, preventing loops. Tested with e2fsprogs which
	  showed the problem in the first place.

2006-03-01 21:13  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/sbin/lin: Reworked this a bit: give it some color,
	  stderr loggin too, and readable now as well.

2006-03-01 21:12  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Bugfix: exiled
	  modules were able to be installed.

2006-03-01 17:12  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/c++,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/cc,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/g++,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/gcc,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/ld,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/make: Updated compiler
	  wrappers: * always use COMPILER_PATH if possible, then use
	  /usr/bin * use $CC $CXX $LD $MAKE is available, otherwise 'cc' and
	  'c++' * optimize for speed a bit by using [[ ]]

2006-03-01 16:03  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/plugins/optimize-wrappers.plugin: No, we
	  cannot set COMPILER_PATH here because the compiler plugin might
	  finish after this plugin, thus it won't work.

2006-03-01 16:00  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/plugins/optimize-wrappers.plugin: *
	  enable USE_WRAPPERS to be overridden by the user (`lunar set
	  USE_WRAPPERS no`) * insert COMPILER_PATH env into PATH

2006-03-01 08:23  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Properly set
	  BUILD - x86/x86_64 are easy. We also cast the $(uname -m) to
	  lowercase as it should be, and append -gnu as well (making
	  "sparc64-linux-gnu"). I'm contemplating making the BUILD variable
	  read-only as you cannot really change it, just like you cannot
	  change the PLATFORM. `arch` will always say i686 too even if you
	  are `i386` optimized completely. Keeping this scheme will simplify
	  things for the plugins.

2006-03-01 07:13  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/build.lunar,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/check.lunar,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Adding a
	  'has_module_file' wrapper before 'run_module_file' - rewriting
	  run_module_file - this way a module can have a BUILD.x86_64
	  WITHOUT a BUILD. Only thing that is still required is a "DETAILS"
	  file.

2006-03-01 06:44  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/build.lunar: Add wrapper
	  support back, some minor important optimizations.

2006-03-01 06:28  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Add
	  'bad_flags' back for backward compatibility - this really should
	  be retired in favour for a complete disabling call of all
	  optimizations.

2006-03-01 01:16  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/plugins/optimize-wrappers.plugin: Adding
	  the optimization wrappers in here as a default-present system
	  wrapper. This is needed to make wrappers work again with the
	  latest changes.

2006-03-01 00:18  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Always set
	  $PLATFORM and $BUILD according to the system (this is done BEFORE
	  local config - so you can override them with `lunar set BUILD`
	  etc.). Also allow the menu to be empty (i.e. no plugins
	  installed).

2006-02-28 06:08  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/build.lunar: <v3rt1g0> sofar,
	  any reason why you got rid of the version info text on install?

2006-02-28 05:58  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/sbin/lunar,

	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/tracking.lunar,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/updatelog.lunar,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/menu/optimize.menu: * New optimization
	  architecture - based on plugins * All optimization menu's and code
	  will move to moonbase plugins * removed optimize.menu *
	  optimize.lunar is now only a plugin stub * pre-compile
	  optimizations are set using the BUILD_BUILD plugin type * remove
	  'optimize' main call to optimizations * Added "custom_filters" to
	  allow on-the-fly compression of man-pages * Attempt to display
	  success/fail log when checking modules * small performance tweak
	  to unmap_device * bugfix for aliases code (bug was not be
	  noticeable to people)

2006-02-25 00:07  moe

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Well well well
	  .. you didn't think of tabs, bro .. But SURPRISE!!!!!11 WE DID!

2006-02-14 20:16  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/ChangeLog: updated

2006-02-12 06:33  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/aliases.lunar,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: Some more
	  optimizations in the most time-consuming parts.

2006-02-12 05:48  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Optimizations
	  and safety : use awk instead of combined grep/cuts, obsolete use
	  of cat.

2006-02-08 18:44  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/misc.lunar: Code speedup -
	  don't run readlink unneededly a lot.

2006-02-07 23:03  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/aliases.lunar: Bugfix - tried
	  to exec $() wrongly.

2006-02-01 21:06  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/build.lunar: Add version
	  number to the message 'building xxx'.

2006-02-01 16:52  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/usr/share/man/man8/lin.8: Did some mild updating.

2006-01-23 03:46  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/build.lunar: Typo fix.

2006-01-16 17:53  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: layout changes:
	  - entire question is now yellow * except for the (is/isnot
	  installed word) * and the description of the optional dependency -
	  highlighted installed dependency in green - highlighted missing
	  dependency in red - reduced "not yet installed" to "not installed"
	  - reduced "already installed" to "installed" - removed the word
	  "dependency" hope that cleans it up a bit.

2006-01-13 17:14  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/init.lunar: Don't assume uid 0
	  == root, instead check if uid($USER) == 0, allows to change the
	  root username to something else. (/me waves to redkennedy).

2006-01-10 01:00  v3rt1g0

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/build.lunar: Changing this
	  back just a bit after talking to sofar. No need to run ./configure
	  twice (as most ./autogen.sh scripts already call configure). Added
	  some of the output that is now in _configure back into the
	  default_cvs_config. Yours Truly, The Lazy Impatient!

2006-01-09 17:43  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/build.lunar: * add /var/games
	  as suggested in the ML * add a _configure wrapper that skips the
	  ./configure step if a Makefile is present but ./configure is
	  missing (fallback operation). Bombs out when both are awol.
	  Redirected all ./configure calls to _configure.

2005-12-31 04:10  tchan

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Fixed some
	  technically incorrect uses of parentheses inside a bash echo
	  command. Parens need to be backslash escaped, like "echo ADDON=\(
	  None \)"

2005-12-28 00:28  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/plugins/download-generic.plugin: tchan>
	  sofar borked it somewhere along the way

2005-12-26 02:21  sofar

	* lunar/branches/stable/var/lib/lunar/aliases,
	  lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/aliases: Deleted into oblivion (see
	  moonbase/aliases).

2005-12-19 18:13  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: Fix for

	  removed my puny nl.lunar-linux.org mirror from the list as it is
	  no longer serving download content (it's just acting as a backup
	  server now mirroring our svn repos and torrents).

2005-11-11 19:53  moe

	  to decide on license names.

2005-10-20 18:46  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/etc/lunar/config: * removed max_sources as it's

	  download.lunar-linux.org for moonbase second URL fallback *
	  generic download.lunar-linux.org for LRESORT and PATCH URL's

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: Somehow
	  sort_by_dependency was a dud, this code actually speeds it up a

	  doing that.

2005-10-10 20:51  tchan

	* lunar/trunk/etc/lunar/mirrors/GNOME: Fixed the planetmirror GNOME
	  URL.

2005-09-29 14:38  tchan

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: I got tired of
	  watching the Deprecated -mcpu messages scroll by, so I removed the
	  -mcpu from the x86 section of optimize.lunar. -march implies
	  -mtune which is the replacement for -mcpu on x86 platforms in
	  gcc-3.4.x. So if anyone is still using gcc-3.3.x this won't break
	  anything as -march there also implies -mcpu.

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/build.lunar: This is the
	  commit to go along with my Dev-ML email (subject: Addition to
	  build.lunar common functions) sent on 18Sep05. This adds a
	  default_game_build and default_game_config as options to be used
	  in BUILD files. This commit also fixes a few minor typos. !!!!!!
	  Please DO NOT use these two functions in any modules that are in
	  the moonbase. This code is being commited here so that devs can
	  easily test the new code. Once it has been tested/approved the
	  change can then be pushed the lunar and both theedge and lunar can
	  get a version bump before we can start making use of it, else
	  stuff will break for the user. !!!!!!!

	  lunar/branches/stable/etc/lunar/mirrors/SFORGE,

	  Modified 'lvu urls' so that it lists ALL mirror sites but never
	  last resort/first resort urls. this makes it produce the same list
	  everywhere. Also adding the crappy osdn.sf.net mirror.

2005-07-27 07:24  sofar

	* lunar/branches/stable/var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar,

2005-06-30 12:27  sofar

2005-06-30 12:15  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Allow nested

2005-06-30 12:03  sofar

	* lunar/trunk/bin/lvu: Feature addition: lvu diff [locally edited

2005-06-24 13:22  tchan

	* lunar/trunk/etc/lunar/config: Yet another hack to fix the double

2005-06-18 21:39  tchan

	* lunar/trunk/var/lib/lunar/plugins/unpack-generic.plugin: Fixed a
	  bug in the assumptions on how source modules are named. NOT all
	  source code is *.tar.gz, see pwlib and openh323 modules (these are
	  named *-tar.gz). I changed the unpack code from *.tar.bz2 to
	  *tar.bz2 and similiarly *.tar.gz to *tar.gz. sofar needs to look
	  at this when he gets back!!!

2005-06-13 15:25  moe

	  sf.net downloads

2005-06-08 11:33  sofar

	* lunar/branches/stable/bin/lvu, lunar/trunk/bin/lvu: Adding a

	* theedge/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/postbuild.lunar: I'm finally

	  gather_docs() I proposed to Lunar-Dev ML about a month ago. As a
	  refresher (or introduction for some) this is what the change is

	  function gather_docs(). It allows a module writer/maintainer to be
	  able to easily install any extra documentation (above and beyond
	  what is already automatically copied over) they feel would be nice
	  to add to the module's default document directory. A common usage
	  would be a line like this found at the end of a BUILD file:
	  gather_docs TODO INDEX Notes extras/* Which would copy the files
	  TODO, INDEX, Notes, and create a subdirectory called extras and
	  copy any files found in that directory to the new directory under
	  the module's default document directory. It obeys (checks for)
	  $GARBAGE=on for you, so you don't need to worry about that when
	  writing the module. The files in the file list must all reside in
	  or below the $SOURCE_DIRECTORY and must be referenced relative to
	  said directory. There is no harm in implementing this now within
	  the moonbase at will. If the user does not have the extended
	  version of gather_docs() (and they have verbose on) s/he will see
	  the default documentation be coppied twice but nothing more.

	  implemented using a depends.cache file which speeds up all
	  dependency work immensely. The time needed to create the cache
	  might still be a little long tho (2:30 uncached on my box).
	  sorting time for entire moonbase is about 2:30 now, mostly
	  spending in the fgrep. sorting time on 400 modules is < 30
	  seconds. - double questions removed - moonbase index creation is
	  now more atomic than it was, it's generated in a tmpfile, then
	  pivoted to the real location, same for depends.cache (crtl-c in
	  the creation will not damage it) - lrm fix that caused files in
	  /boot to be deleted. as far as I can see this was still an TODO
	  left open by kongar&&those-before-him (ouch). tested and works. -
	  added $DEPENDS_CACHE var in etc/lunar/config

	  for devs who overwrite their work with 'lin moonbase' and the like
	  (and yes this is the *real* reason for adding this little hack).

	  created by the time we get here.

	  mailbox flood, but rather something I've been working on for about
	  3.4 weeks now. Some fundamental things have changed in the code
	  and from the outside not much may have changed, but this is a 2400
	  line merge! Biggest differences is in the function calling and
	  temporary file generation, which now has a complete unique ID and
	  gets cleaned up better. All major functions have been rewritten to
	  handle $@ and return data over STDOUT. Upgrading and installing
	  multiple modules has been rewritten, all frontends are now true
	  frontends (no standard code in there anymore). I added some
	  gadgets for CVS options thanks to jol, and there's a framework for
	  downloading code from SVN:// urls, which I haven't been able to
	  check yet... someone please try. some gaps still remain, this *IS*
	  theedge. I suspect resurrect behaviour to be broken, as well as
	  the download monitoring (but at least it works). At least I'll be
	  able to track most of the bugs now pretty fast, as I know where
	  there still is more work to do... Noted also that md5sum checking
	  was down in theedge up to this one, as for quite some few other
	  bugs... should be all fixed I hope. Please make sure that you run
	  the theedge code for testing, I really need the feedback on this
	  in the coming 2 weeks. Thanks, sofar PS fortune of the day: Live
	  fast, die young, and leave a flat patch of fur on the highway! --

	* theedge/trunk/sbin/lin, theedge/trunk/sbin/lrm,
	  theedge/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar,
	  theedge/trunk/var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Fix for (1) tar error on

	  verbose messages. Also, the remove_module which people assumed to
	  be removed incedentally was removed again, since the call is made
	  by lrm (l228,l296). PLEASE LEAVE IT OUT NOW, since doing this
	  belongs in the lrm code.

2003-02-14 15:52  tchan

	* theedge/trunk/var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Added back in the
	  "missing" call to remove_modules. I believe it is still required

2003-02-05 23:53  sofar

2003-02-05 23:52  sofar

	* theedge/trunk/sbin/lrm: First couple of fixes: * no bailout when
	  no DETAILS found (lrm should be possible afterall the install log
	  is there) * add --keepconfig in order prepare_install functions
	  normally * missing md5sum should PRESERVE config files just in
	  case, as we know lunar already makes good md5sums, and in case
	  that feature is off bad things go happen * updated help. TODO: -
	  add regex support for excluded/protected like /etc/.*\.conf -
	  speed profile removal queue processing: it is *SLOW*, consider
	  reimporting old lrm routine which constructs a large grep
	  statement (hazardous: command line chars are expensive and bash
	  can only handle so much) - test

	* theedge/trunk/lib/lsb/init-functions: Added 'mk_spid()' function,

	  'pidok()' functions to prevent lunar from wiping out the
	  /var/run/*.pid files of daemons which create these files on thier
	  own. This allows sshd to be restarted remotely, killing only the
	  server process.

2003-02-01 16:04  csm

	* theedge/trunk/ChangeLog: Updated

2003-02-01 14:55  sofar

	* theedge/trunk/sbin/lget: Okay, here's the problem: you implement
	  downloading with locking, so lin can call lget without worrying
	  wether it is already downloading or now, now you add another
	  download option, but you forget to add locking to that feature. As
	  you can guess, when you try to install AND lin forces a download
	  through that other feature, it will start to download it, and then
	  probe for it again just before pre_build, because lin calls lget
	  twice somehow. Not at all a problem, unless you forget to add the
	  locking mechanism to the other feature, right? (short: implemented
	  locking where it is needed, should fix download/lin problems of
	  CVS modules)

	  theedge/trunk/var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Generalizing code: less

	  gain.

2003-01-29 10:28  sofar

	  Removing it here.

2003-01-01 22:46  sofar

	* theedge/trunk/sbin/lget, theedge/trunk/var/lib/lunar/subroutines:
	  Adding code to store CVS-sources after 'co' or 'up' into
	  SOURCE_CACHE, so that the source code is always clean when lin
	  runs, and we still have the possibility of doing incremental
	  updates. Also added a small visual message in sedit () to
	  verbosely show that files are edited.

2003-01-01 21:31  sofar

	* theedge/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/updatelog.lunar: This should

	* theedge/trunk/ChangeLog: updated

2002-12-23 00:49  sofar

	* theedge/trunk/sbin/lin: Added auto-patching: scan for subdir
	  'patch' and apply all regular files in that directory before
	  BUILD/default_build. Note patch order is equal to 'ls'.

2002-12-22 17:40  tchan

	* theedge/trunk/sbin/lunar: Fixed the help message for KEEP_SOURCE
	  to make sure its clear why you would turn this flag on.

2002-12-22 17:04  tchan

	* theedge/trunk/sbin/lunar: Better explanation of the KEEP_SOURCE
	  option in Lunar help message. KEEP_SOURCE toggles the default
	  behavior in Lunar core tools of removing /usr/src/module code
	  after a SUCCESSFUL compile. Default behavior has always been to
	  remove the module source after a succesful compile and KEEP the
	  source after a failed compile. Xoritor added the KEEP_SOURCE flag
	  for developers using the gcc profiling tools as the tools need
	  access to the source code even after a good compile. This option
	  is not to be used for removing source code after a failed compile.
	  Someone else can add another flag for always removing source code
	  but that will probably break this option flag for the developers
	  using the profiling code.

2002-12-22 07:02  tchan

	* theedge/trunk/sbin/lin: Reverted the lin code to the old behavior
	  of NOT deleting source code when a compile fails. It IS necessary
	  to keep source code around for failed compiles as the compile log
	  does NOT contain all the necessary information to fix a failed
	  compile -- especially when debugging failed GNU autotools type
	  problems. Having to run Lunar menu to turn on the keep source
	  option and then recompile a failed module is a BIG waste of time.
	  Please leave this behavior alone! Keep failed source code around.

2002-12-21 22:49  sofar

	* theedge/trunk/sbin/lin: Default compile fail will remove the
	  sources from /usr/src. Since logging of compiles and activity is
	  now in order, this is no longer needed, and prevent a big mess
	  from happening in case your lunar rebuild goes booboo.

2002-12-16 16:47  sofar

	* theedge/trunk/ChangeLog: updated

2002-12-16 10:48  sofar

	  theedge/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/cc,

2002-12-09 21:24  xoritor

	  CVS_LOGIN to behave better.

2002-12-09 10:20  sofar

	* theedge/trunk/sbin/lget: Adding download failure logging including
	  URLS

2002-12-08 19:16  xoritor

	* theedge/trunk/var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Fixed installed_version
	  when checking version of "installed linux".

2002-12-08 18:34  xoritor

	* theedge/trunk/var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Added 2 keywords for
	  bad_flags, compiler and linker. bad_flags compiler unsets all
	  compiler flags set by CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, and CPPFLAGS. bad_flags
	  linker unsets all linker flags set by LDFLAGS.

2002-12-08 18:28  csm

	* theedge/trunk/ChangeLog: Updated

2002-12-08 18:04  xoritor

	* theedge/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar,
	  theedge/trunk/var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Added 2 new subroutines
	  (bad_flags and patch_it): bad_flags is a subroutine to remove any
	  known bad flags on a per module basis, this effects system CFLAGS,
	  CXXFLAGS, and CPPFLAGS as well as optimizations chosen in lunar.
	  It is to be used as follows: bad_flags <list of bad CFLAGS and
	  LDFLAGS> Example: bad_flags -ffast-math -funroll-loops -s Or to
	  remove ALL optimizations use: bad_flags ALL (Case matters!)
	  patch_it is a subroutine to create a generic patching interface
	  for lunar modules it is to be used as follows: patch_it <patch
	  location/patch name> <patch level> Example: patch_it
	  $SOURCE_CACHE/4.2.0-4.2.1.diff.gz 1 Added more support for
	  KEEP_SOURCE options into default_prebuild.

2002-12-08 00:52  tchan

	* theedge/trunk/sbin/lin, theedge/trunk/sbin/lunar: Hacked in
	  $KEEP_SOURCE into lunar menu and fixed lin to use $KEEP_SOURCE.
	  This allows sysadmin to tell "lin" to keep the source code in
	  /usr/src and as opposed to the default behavior of removing source
	  code on successful builds.

2002-12-07 20:47  xoritor

	* theedge/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar,
	  theedge/trunk/var/lib/lunar/menu/optimize.menu: Updating
	  optimizations: Added C warnings options: -Wno-deprecated Added C++
	  warnings options: -Wno-deprecated Added Speed options:
	  -fexpensive-optimizations -falign-double Added framework for Stack
	  optimization/manipulation, this can be different for each
	  platform. Currently only the x86 is supported
	  (-mpreferred-stack-boundary) but should allow others to be added
	  easily.

2002-12-04 13:30  sofar

	* theedge/trunk/bin/lvu: Fix for the '/levels-list: no such file...'
	  bug. (SCRIPT_DIRECTORY undeclared)

2002-12-04 08:42  tchan

	* theedge/trunk/var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Added to the activity_log

2002-10-14 14:02  sofar

	* theedge/trunk/var/state/lunar/blacklist.x86: Removed ddd from the
	  blacklist. It now correctly compiles with gcc-3.2.

2002-10-05 05:39  tchan

	* theedge/trunk/var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Fixed a long standing bug
	  on why the /usr/share/info/dir file keeps getting trashed.
	  prepare_install was not saving /usr/share/info/dir and that file
	  is being tracked by installwatch so it becomes part of the tar.bz2
	  file. So inside prepare_install, if the module is already
	  installed, it removes the existing module before completing the
	  install. This would remove the exisiting /usr/share/info/dir and
	  then replace it with a very short version of /usr/share/info/dir.

	* theedge/trunk/ChangeLog: Updated

2002-10-03 16:51  xoritor

2002-10-03 15:55  xoritor

	* theedge/trunk/var/state/lunar/blacklist.x86,
	  theedge/trunk/var/state/lunar/gcc.x86: Removing gcc.x86 list
	  (unused) Adding blacklist.x86 with contents: ddd rythmbox
	  gstreamer

2002-10-03 15:50  xoritor

	* theedge/trunk/sbin/lin: Fixed the issue with --fix installing
	  "held" modules. this will no longer happen. Added support for a
	  "blacklist" again it is still in /var/state/lunar, but the aname
	  has changed to blacklist.$PLATFORM (defaults to x86). This will
	  NOT let a blacklisted module install at all and terminates lin
	  when a blacklisted module is encountered. I realize this could
	  cause issues, and I am looking for a better solution... feel free
	  to post ideas.

2002-10-01 17:34  sofar

	* theedge/trunk/var/lib/lunar/subroutines: lin moonbase now
	  explicitly rebuilds the module.index

	  :-)

2002-09-24 16:59  xoritor

	* theedge/trunk/sbin/lin: Updating lin to not set PATH, other than
	  to add for the wrappers. Added an echo to say wether a module is
	  blacklisted or not, but does not do anything but echo. This is a
	  placeholder for future code that will allow a blacklist for gcc 2x
	  or optimization unfriendly modules to be easily identified.

2002-09-24 16:52  xoritor

	* theedge/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Adding PSAFE
	  to optimize_make(). PSAFE=no can be added to a DETAILS file to set
	  MAKES=1 so that multiple makes do not occur

2002-09-24 02:51  tchan

	* theedge/trunk/var/state/lunar/gcc.x86: unrar now compiles with
	  gcc-3.2 or greater.

2002-09-23 23:59  sofar

	* theedge/trunk/sbin/lin, theedge/trunk/usr/share/man/man8/lin.8,
	  theedge/trunk/var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Adding proper fix for lin
	  --fix: lin --fixdepends will ONLY rebuild your depends database,
	  without recompiling modules!

2002-09-23 21:03  sofar

	* theedge/trunk/var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Incremental numbered
	  backups removed: they might confuse xinetd! Just don't cp a new
	  version if it already exists, since most likely the SA modified it
	  and we should leave it alone.

2002-09-23 12:05  kongar

	* theedge/trunk/ChangeLog: Updated

2002-09-23 12:03  kongar

	* theedge/trunk/var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Hacked subroutines to
	  support the creation of /tmp/depends.updated to aide in
	  edit/repair of /var/state/lunar/depends. This will prevent massive
	  recompiling of the entire lunar box when the depends file gets out
	  of whack.

2002-09-22 07:03  tchan

	* theedge/trunk/sbin/lin: Hacked lin to support
	  /var/state/lunar/depends editing/repair using the file
	  /tmp/depends.updated.

	  while now.

2002-09-20 15:36  tchan

	* theedge/trunk/var/state/lunar/gcc.x86: Removed smpeg from this
	  list as it compiles correctly now with gcc-3.2, after applying
	  wyatt_earp's fix.

2002-09-20 15:20  tchan

2002-09-18 09:26  sofar

	* theedge/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Fixing order
	  of distcc (ccache distcc gcc and not distcc ccache gcc), and
	  adding distcc to the c++ compiler addons, since mozilla and others
	  compiled fine with it.

2002-09-12 23:53  sofar

	* theedge/trunk/var/lib/lunar/compilers/c++: Adding c++ wrapper

2002-09-10 23:19  sofar

	  and there is no good way to fix this right now in Lunar. Commented
	  out with Xoritor's blessing!

2002-09-02 05:25  csm

	* theedge/trunk/ChangeLog: Updated

2002-09-02 02:38  tchan

	* theedge/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Okay, this
	  version of optimize.lunar incorporates sofar's "menu checklist"
	  fix but does NOT include his nowrap code which is still broken.
	  This version correctly has niki's fix for the Debug strip
	  optimization. sofar needs to check the sense of his [ -n $NOWRAP ]
	  test. If I do NOT have $NOWRAP set, then I obviously want the
	  lunar gcc wrappers but his code will NOT export the CC,CXX,CCC
	  variables correctly.

2002-09-02 02:04  csm

2002-08-25 12:45  sofar

	* theedge/trunk/etc/lunar/mirrors/SOURCEFORGE: New mirror in chechia

2002-08-24 23:27  tchan

	* theedge/trunk/ChangeLog: Ran brutus:tools/cvs2cl.pl and edited out
	  csm huge copy over.

2002-08-23 11:39  sofar

	* theedge/trunk/sbin/lin: Added compile fail log msg

2002-08-23 11:34  sofar

	* theedge/trunk/sbin/lin: Fixed installwatchfile cleanup on failed
	  compiles

2002-08-23 10:30  sofar

	* theedge/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/updatelog.lunar: Suspect
	  this was a typo!

2002-08-23 10:18  sofar

	* theedge/trunk/sbin/lunar: Fix: wasn't installing LUNAR_MODULE
	  conditionally

2002-08-22 21:47  xoritor

	* theedge/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Removed
	  cc_optimize and ccc_optimize functions in order to better
	  implement the wrapper method: Enable calling of any ADDON, CC,
	  CCC, and CXX options. Calls one program so libtool does not die.
	  Fixes many compile issues with broken builds. Enables ccache and
	  distcc to work transparently. Requires lunar-gcc and lunar-g++ to
	  be installed in /usr/bin, they will be in the installed by the gcc
	  module.

	* theedge/trunk/usr/sbin/lget, theedge/trunk/usr/sbin/lin,
	  theedge/trunk/usr/sbin/lrm, theedge/trunk/usr/sbin/lrm2,
	  theedge/trunk/usr/sbin/lunar, theedge/trunk/usr/sbin/lvis,
	  theedge/trunk/usr/sbin/lvu: Moved these files to /sbin. lvu moved
	  to /bin. This is for the people that have /usr on a seperate
	  partition. The lunar tools have to be available.

2002-08-22 03:04  tchan

	* theedge/trunk/install: Modified this to add the /bin and /sbin
	  directories.

2002-08-22 03:02  tchan

	* theedge/trunk/bin, theedge/trunk/bin/lvu: Moved this file from
	  /usr/sbin to /bin. This helps with people who have /usr mounted as
	  a seperate partition. lvu is in /bin because non-root users can
	  use it too!

	  theedge/trunk/sbin/lin, theedge/trunk/sbin/lrm,
	  theedge/trunk/sbin/lrm2, theedge/trunk/sbin/lunar,
	  theedge/trunk/sbin/lvis: Moved these files from /usr/sbin to
	  /sbin. This helps with people who have /usr on a seperate
	  partition.

2002-08-21 11:30  sofar

	* theedge/trunk/var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Added fancy_progress for
	  sort_install_queue

2002-08-21 03:22  tchan

	* theedge/trunk/var/lib/lunar/solo: Fixed the entry for gcc3. There
	  is no gcc3, only gcc and gcc2 modules now.

2002-08-21 02:51  xoritor

	* theedge/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Fixed type-o
	  in optimize_make (was optimaze_make).

2002-08-21 01:39  xoritor

	* theedge/trunk/var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Preliminary
	  make optimization support: Allow make -jN to be set and used.
