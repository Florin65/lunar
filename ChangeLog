2003-02-16 13:27  sofar

	* sbin/lin, var/lib/lunar/subroutines,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/postbuild.lunar: More cleanups, splitting
	out all postbuild extensions (xinetd, init.d, pamd etc). Bugfix
	#248.

2003-02-15 23:47  sofar

	* sbin/lunar: Fix for #221

2003-02-15 23:17  sofar

	* sbin/lin, var/lib/lunar/subroutines: verbose pruning and boost
	problems GONE FOREVER

2003-02-15 22:38  sofar

	* sbin/lin: wheps

2003-02-15 21:59  sofar

	* sbin/lsh: Adding this little gadget: lsh, a 'shell' wrapper
	around the lunar.

2003-02-15 20:51  sofar

	* sbin/lget: CVS fixed that were needed. let's not spend too much
	time here.

2003-02-15 20:09  sofar

	* sbin/lin, sbin/lrm, var/lib/lunar/subroutines,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Fix for (1) tar error on
	cache, removed --verbose from lrm, cleaned up more code, unified
	verbose messages.
	
	Also, the remove_module which people assumed to be removed
	incedentally was removed again, since the call is made by lrm
	(l228,l296). PLEASE LEAVE IT OUT NOW, since doing this belongs in
	the lrm code.

2003-02-14 15:52  tchan

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Added back in the "missing" call to
	remove_modules.  I believe it is still required and was removed by
	sofar accidentally in his clean up.

2003-02-14 00:06  sofar

	* sbin/lin, sbin/lunar, var/lib/lunar/excluded,
	var/lib/lunar/subroutines, var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar:
	Major code update, including VERBOSE flag (default off, cos lin is
	still noisy), lots and lots of core rewrites, optimizations,
	formatting and spacing, removal of old and unused code, etc.

2003-02-13 12:25  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: more more cleanups

	speedups.

2003-02-08 02:30  csm

	* etc/lunar/config: changing the last resort URL to .org instead of
	.com

2003-02-06 10:08  sofar

	* sbin/lrm: heh, got scared?

2003-02-06 00:00  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Adding --keepconfig in here to get
	lunar renew working again, see lrm commit.

2003-02-05 23:53  sofar

	* sbin/lin: adding --keepconfig so config files stay untouched.

2003-02-05 23:52  sofar

	* sbin/lrm: First couple of fixes:
	
	* no bailout when no DETAILS found (lrm should be possible afterall
	the install log is there) * add --keepconfig in order
	prepare_install functions normally * missing md5sum should PRESERVE
	config files just in case, as we know lunar already makes good
	md5sums, and in case that feature is off bad things go happen *
	updated help.
	
	TODO:
	
	- add regex support for excluded/protected like /etc/.*\.conf -
	speed profile removal queue processing: it is *SLOW*, consider
	reimporting old lrm routine which constructs a large grep statement
	(hazardous: command line chars are expensive and bash can only
	handle so much) - test

2003-02-05 14:17  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/excluded: and more

2003-02-05 13:23  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/excluded: Adding some more in here

	* var/lib/lunar/excluded: some more additions

2003-02-03 22:18  csm

	* var/lib/lunar/excluded: adding critical postfix files

2003-02-03 14:29  elaine

	* lib/lsb/init-functions: Added 'mk_spid()' function, to be used on
	starting a daemon and modified 'mk_pid()' and 'pidok()' functions
	to prevent lunar from wiping out the /var/run/*.pid files of
	daemons which create these files on thier own.	This allows sshd to
	be restarted remotely, killing only the server process.

2003-02-02 00:08  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/menu/optimize.menu: More info for the meek

2003-02-01 23:31  sofar

2003-02-01 16:27  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: I thought I added this
	already

2003-02-01 16:26  sofar

	* sbin/lin: Cleaning up here: we don't really need that message
	since blacklist.x86 is EMPTY.

2003-02-01 14:55  sofar

	* sbin/lget: Okay, here's the problem: you implement downloading
	with locking, so lin can call lget without worrying wether it is
	already downloading or now, now you add another download option,
	but you forget to add locking to that feature. As you can guess,
	when you try to install AND lin forces a download through that
	other feature, it will start to download it, and then probe for it
	again just before pre_build, because lin calls lget twice somehow.
	Not at all a problem, unless you forget to add the locking
	mechanism to the other feature, right? (short: implemented locking
	where it is needed, should fix download/lin problems of CVS
	modules)

2003-02-01 05:18  wizfactor

	* sbin/lin: Finished updating xinet (bug 232)

2003-02-01 01:08  wizfactor

	* sbin/lin: Fixed bug in the xinet.d services install. Should fix
	bug 232.

2003-01-30 05:22  tchan

	more fixes.

2003-01-29 20:26  sofar

	* sbin/lunar: Fix for that nasty one bug.

2003-01-29 19:34  tchan

	* usr/share/man/man8/lfirsttime.8: Updated the URL's and added a
	bit more info.

2003-01-29 12:27  sofar

	* bin/lvu, sbin/lin, sbin/lrm, sbin/lunar, usr/sbin/colony,
	var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Generalizing code: less is now replaced
	with view_file(), which also handles stdin of course. It also will
	use the $PAGER env variable for those who want to override it with
	their default pager. Small effort, big gain.

2003-01-29 10:28  sofar

	* bin/lvu, usr/share/man/man1/lvu.1: Adding functionality to view
	the logfile easier: 'lvu activity'

2003-01-25 23:17  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Nice going ;^)

2003-01-25 22:01  sofar

	handling code.

2003-01-24 21:00  sofar

	* sbin/lget: Last modifications to cvs/lget - better source tree
	management, trapdoors removed.

2003-01-21 11:53  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Code change: sedit now handles
	multiple files in one sedit statement, and in place backups are no
	longer made.

2003-01-20 15:23  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/sustained: Sorry for the gpm fans, but gpm is *NOT*
	a vital package for the correct functioning of lunar. Removing it
	here.

2003-01-19 23:14  sofar

	* etc/lunar/mirrors/LRESORT: Popping in DNS names!

2003-01-17 14:22  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Bugfix: fix for missing
	'ChangeLog' module when running lget without a module name. Rewrote
	all fcuntions to use base functions instead of rewriting
	list_sections 4 times. Code cleanups. Added ChangeLog to ignore
	list in list_modules and list_sections.

2003-01-17 14:04  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Simplified sedit.

2003-01-05 20:31  sofar

	* etc/lunar/config: New default LRESORT URL.

2003-01-05 20:29  sofar

	* etc/lunar/mirrors/LRESORT: Putting new source caches in here.

2003-01-02 22:27  sofar

	* sbin/lget: Fix for broken cvs update being stored in
	$SOURCE_CACHE, beautified, removed unset CVS_RSH.

2003-01-02 16:18  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Adding support to handle TARred patch
	sets!

2003-01-02 14:32  sofar

	* sbin/lunar: Adding "Maintenance" menu that allows you to run lin
	--fix, --nofix, --fixdepends from the menu system.

2003-01-01 23:24  sofar

	* sbin/lin: Removing autopatch scheme

2003-01-01 22:46  sofar

	* sbin/lget, var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Adding code to store
	CVS-sources after 'co' or 'up' into SOURCE_CACHE, so that the
	source code is always clean when lin runs, and we still have the
	possibility of doing incremental updates. Also added a small visual
	message in sedit () to verbosely show that files are edited.

2003-01-01 21:31  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/updatelog.lunar: This should fix the
	weird messages after a lunar update/renew

2002-12-30 22:24  hardkrash

	* sbin/lget: added ability to use tun devices for internet
	connection -- Hardkrash

2002-12-29 23:42  sofar

	* etc/lunar/config: Added PATCH_URL to config, the new repository
	for patches.

2002-12-24 18:19  tchan

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/updatelog.lunar: Synched a change from
	lunar version of updatelog.lunar back into theedge.

2002-12-24 18:00  xoritor

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Fixed MAKES and PSAFE
	issues.

2002-12-23 01:10  sofar

	* sbin/lin: okay this works now without CVS bullocking it.

2002-12-23 01:07  sofar

	* sbin/lin: leave out the * to omit subdirs in case of CVS.

2002-12-23 01:00  sofar

	* usr/share/doc/lunar/module-example/patch/example.patch: Adding
	some descriptive text.

2002-12-23 00:49  sofar

	* sbin/lin: Added auto-patching: scan for subdir 'patch' and apply
	all regular files in that directory before BUILD/default_build.
	Note patch order is equal to 'ls'.

2002-12-22 17:40  tchan

	* sbin/lunar: Fixed the help message for KEEP_SOURCE to make sure
	its clear why you would turn this flag on.

2002-12-22 17:04  tchan

	* sbin/lunar: Better explanation of the KEEP_SOURCE option in Lunar
	help message.  KEEP_SOURCE toggles the default behavior in Lunar
	core tools of removing /usr/src/module code after a SUCCESSFUL
	compile.  Default behavior has always been to remove the module
	source after a succesful compile and KEEP the source after a failed
	compile.  Xoritor added the KEEP_SOURCE flag for developers using
	the gcc profiling tools as the tools need access to the source code
	even after a good compile.  This option is not to be used for
	removing source code after a failed compile.  Someone else can add
	another flag for always removing source code but that will probably
	break this option flag for the developers using the profiling code.

2002-12-22 07:02  tchan

	* sbin/lin: Reverted the lin code to the old behavior of NOT
	deleting source code when a compile fails.  It IS necessary to keep
	source code around for failed compiles as the compile log does NOT
	contain all the necessary information to fix a failed compile --
	especially when debugging failed GNU autotools type problems. 
	Having to run Lunar menu to turn on the keep source option and then
	recompile a failed module is a BIG waste of time.  Please leave
	this behavior alone!  Keep failed source code around.

2002-12-21 22:49  sofar

	* sbin/lin: Default compile fail will remove the sources from
	/usr/src. Since logging of compiles and activity is now in order,
	this is no longer needed, and prevent a big mess from happening in
	case your lunar rebuild goes booboo.

2002-12-16 10:48  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/compilers/: c++, cc, g++, gcc: Better wrappers: sed
	off wrapper path to make ccache work again.

2002-12-11 21:39  xoritor

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Fixed KEEP_SOURCE bug.

2002-12-09 21:24  xoritor

	* sbin/lget: Adding quiet opton to cvs update and checkout, now
	only important messages will be printed.
	
	Fixed CVS_LOGIN to behave better.

2002-12-09 10:20  sofar

	* sbin/lget: Adding download failure logging including URLS

2002-12-08 19:16  xoritor

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Fixed installed_version when checking
	version of "installed linux".

2002-12-08 18:34  xoritor

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Added 2 keywords for bad_flags,
	compiler and linker.
	
	  bad_flags compiler unsets all compiler flags set by CFLAGS,
	CXXFLAGS, and CPPFLAGS.
	
	  bad_flags linker unsets all linker flags set by LDFLAGS.

2002-12-08 18:04  xoritor

	* var/lib/lunar/: subroutines, functions/optimize.lunar: Added 2
	new subroutines (bad_flags and patch_it):
	
	  bad_flags is a subroutine to remove any known bad flags on a per
	module basis, this effects system CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, and CPPFLAGS as
	well as optimizations chosen in lunar.	It is to be used as
	follows:
	
	    bad_flags <list of bad CFLAGS and LDFLAGS>
	
	      Example:
	      bad_flags -ffast-math -funroll-loops -s
	
	    Or to remove ALL optimizations use:
	      bad_flags ALL (Case matters!)
	
	  patch_it is a subroutine to create a generic patching interface
	for lunar modules it is to be used as follows:
	
	    patch_it <patch location/patch name> <patch level>
	
	      Example:
		patch_it $SOURCE_CACHE/4.2.0-4.2.1.diff.gz 1
	
	Added more support for KEEP_SOURCE options into default_prebuild.

2002-12-08 00:52  tchan

	* sbin/: lin, lunar: Hacked in $KEEP_SOURCE into lunar menu and
	fixed lin to use $KEEP_SOURCE.	This allows sysadmin to tell "lin"
	to keep the source code in /usr/src and as opposed to the default
	behavior of removing source code on successful builds.

2002-12-07 20:47  xoritor

	* var/lib/lunar/: functions/optimize.lunar, menu/optimize.menu:
	Updating optimizations:   Added C warnings options:    
	-Wno-deprecated
	
	  Added C++ warnings options:
	    -Wno-deprecated
	
	  Added Speed options:
	    -fexpensive-optimizations
	    -falign-double
	
	  Added framework for Stack optimization/manipulation, this can be
	different for each platform. Currently only the x86 is supported
	(-mpreferred-stack-boundary) but should allow others to be added
	easily.

2002-12-04 13:30  sofar

	* bin/lvu: Fix for the '/levels-list: no such file...' bug.
	(SCRIPT_DIRECTORY undeclared)

2002-12-04 08:42  tchan

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Added to the activity_log function a
	timestamp as part of the datestamp.

2002-11-28 16:05  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Fix #189

2002-11-28 15:41  sofar

	* sbin/lin: Fix for doubly reporting a failed compile, once as
	failed, once as success.

2002-11-26 14:56  kc8apf

	* lib/lsb/init-functions: Fix documented in Lunar

2002-11-21 05:20  hardkrash

	* var/lib/lunar/menu/optimize.menu: Added PPC and Power options to
	lunar menu and corrected menu info for optizations

2002-11-21 05:18  hardkrash

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Added PPC and power
	options to lunar optimizations
