	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Removed cc_optimize and
	ccc_optimize functions in order to better implement the wrapper
	method:   Enable calling of any ADDON, CC, CCC, and CXX options.   
	Calls one program so libtool does not die.    Fixes many compile
	issues with broken builds.    Enables ccache and distcc to work
	transparently.
	
	Requires lunar-gcc and lunar-g++ to be installed in /usr/bin, they
	will be in the installed by the gcc module.

	* usr/sbin/: lget, lin, lrm, lrm2, lunar, lvis, lvu: Moved these
	files to /sbin.  lvu moved to /bin.  This is for the people that
	have /usr on a seperate partition.  The lunar tools have to be
	available.

	* install: Modified this to add the /bin and /sbin directories.

2002-08-22 03:02  tchan

	* bin/lvu: Moved this file from /usr/sbin to /bin.  This helps with
	people who have /usr mounted as a seperate partition.  lvu is in
	/bin because non-root users can use it too!
