	* sbin/lin: Added compile fail log msg

2002-08-23 06:34  sofar

	* sbin/lin: Fixed installwatchfile cleanup on failed compiles

2002-08-23 05:30  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/updatelog.lunar: Suspect this was a typo!

2002-08-23 05:18  sofar

	* sbin/lunar: Fix: wasn't installing LUNAR_MODULE conditionally

2002-08-22 16:47  xoritor

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Removed cc_optimize and
	ccc_optimize functions in order to better implement the wrapper
	method:   Enable calling of any ADDON, CC, CCC, and CXX options.   
	Calls one program so libtool does not die.    Fixes many compile
	issues with broken builds.    Enables ccache and distcc to work
	transparently.
	
	Requires lunar-gcc and lunar-g++ to be installed in /usr/bin, they
	will be in the installed by the gcc module.

	* usr/sbin/: lget, lin, lrm, lrm2, lunar, lvis, lvu: Moved these
	files to /sbin.  lvu moved to /bin.  This is for the people that
	have /usr on a seperate partition.  The lunar tools have to be
	available.

2002-08-21 22:04  tchan

	* install: Modified this to add the /bin and /sbin directories.

2002-08-21 22:02  tchan

	* bin/lvu: Moved this file from /usr/sbin to /bin.  This helps with
	people who have /usr mounted as a seperate partition.  lvu is in
	/bin because non-root users can use it too!

2002-08-21 22:01  tchan

	* sbin/: lget, lin, lrm, lrm2, lunar, lvis: Moved these files from
	/usr/sbin to /sbin.  This helps with people who have /usr on a
	seperate partition.

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Added fancy_progress for
	sort_install_queue

2002-08-20 22:22  tchan

	* var/lib/lunar/solo: Fixed the entry for gcc3.  There is no gcc3,
	only gcc and gcc2 modules now.

2002-08-20 21:51  xoritor

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Fixed type-o in
	optimize_make (was optimaze_make).

2002-08-20 20:39  xoritor

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Preliminary make
	optimization support:	Allow make -jN to be set and used.

2002-08-20 15:18  xoritor

	* var/lib/lunar/: functions/optimize.lunar, menu/optimize.menu:
	Added Float (-ffloat-store) option to the menu.  Enabled addon use
	(ccache and distcc) not just selection.  Finished descriptions on
	XTRA menu.

2002-08-20 13:01  dem

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Fixed a c++ and -pipe
	typo in the CXX variable

2002-08-20 11:38  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Bugfix: allow scripts to switch IW on
	and off without removing an existing installwatch log file.

2002-08-20 03:07  xoritor

	* var/lib/lunar/: functions/optimize.lunar, menu/optimize.menu:
	Enabled multiple selection of "extra features":   XTRA is now an
	array holding all of your options.    Multiple options are allowed,
	but be careful, not all are compatible!      XTRA=( mmx dnow )

2002-08-19 23:43  xoritor

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Updates to CXX
	implementaions.

2002-08-19 22:05  xoritor

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: True fix for exporting
	CXX not just a CXX=CCC hackfix.

2002-08-19 19:35  xoritor

	* var/lib/lunar/menu/optimize.menu: Fixed wrong setting of some
	variables:   FPM and XTRA now set correct values.

2002-08-19 18:53  sofar

	* usr/share/man/man1/lvu.1: Added orphans

2002-08-19 18:50  sofar

	* usr/sbin/lvu: Added lvu orphans: checks installed modules for
	missing required dependancies.

2002-08-19 18:17  sofar

	* usr/: sbin/lvu, share/man/man1/lvu.1: Renamed orphans to 'leafs'

	should be CXXFLAGS.

	"lin <list of modules incliding "moonbase">"

	* var/lib/lunar/solo: Synced and added theedge and moonbase

2002-08-19 12:06  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Away with clean_moonbase!

2002-08-19 05:35  xoritor

	optimizations.

2002-08-19 04:40  xoritor
