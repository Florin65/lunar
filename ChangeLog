	* var/lib/lunar/functions/moonbase.lunar: Adding more proper
	handling of moonbase: - create md5sum log (just for kicks, not
	really used) - proper install log - call lrm to clean up install
	and md5sum logs on new update

	* bin/lvu, var/lib/lunar/functions/build.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: lvu eert fix, adding
	prototype cpan module handling (ugly, yes)

2003-11-26 16:59  tchan

	* var/state/lunar/: blacklist.Alpha, blacklist.PowerPC,
	blacklist.SPARC: Added uml to the blacklist.  Its an x86 module
	ONLY.

2003-11-25 23:22  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/uniqid.lunar: Fixes moonbase downloads
	time-outing if dbguin is down... we prolly have to merge this into
	lunar ASAP.

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Providing for ARCH
	specific script files *note* all x86 = <SCRIPT>.i386

2003-11-16 00:19  hardkrash

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/: install.lunar, messages.lunar: added
	xterm status messages

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: Just pushing around the
	formatting again

2003-11-14 17:37  tchan

	* var/state/lunar/: blacklist.Alpha, blacklist.PowerPC,
	blacklist.SPARC: The current module for uClibc will only compile on
	x86.  uClibc does support other architectures, but the Lunar module
	is currently setup for x86 ONLY!

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/install.lunar: Always keep a copy of the
	scripts used to create a module. This is intended to be useful for
	general backtracking, debugging and to provide an adjunct to the
	activity file to know what's been done without resorting to cvs
	history.
	
	Also safeguards local development work for devs who overwrite their
	work with 'lin moonbase' and the like (and yes this is the *real*
	reason for adding this little hack).
	
	Adding this to post_install because at this point we know that we
	have a successful install (logs and everything have in theory been
	created by the time we get here.

	* var/lib/lunar/compilers/gcc: Missed one

2003-11-06 22:29  sofar

	* sbin/lin, var/lib/lunar/compilers/cc,
	var/lib/lunar/compilers/gcc, var/lib/lunar/functions/install.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/main.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/moonbase.lunar: Syncing some fixes:
	
	 - compiler wrappers showed wrong compile call
	 - get_moonbase breakage detection
	 - cpan:// module installing native supported (need to commit
	example modules, please be patient)
	 - autoresurrect logging disabled (too much noise in logs,
	especially with sound on).

2003-11-02 15:27  elaine

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: Minor tweak to prompt,
	split to 2 lines, should now fit 80col.

2003-11-02 02:25  elaine

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/depends.lunar: Added install-status to
	opt-deps query and clarified the query text

2003-10-24 22:38  tchan

	* var/state/lunar/: blacklist.Alpha, blacklist.PowerPC,
	blacklist.SPARC, blacklist.x86: Updated the blacklist files for
	known problem modules across several architectures.  Getting ready
	for the SPARC64 iso.

2003-10-19 04:36  tchan

	* var/lib/lunar/: functions/optimize.lunar, menu/optimize.menu:
	Updated the SPARC sections of optimize.lunar and optimize.menu. 
	Still needs some work in the CPU hint section as "cat
	/proc/cpuinfo" does NOT return a "model type" string -- instead it
	returns a "type" string and a "cpu" string.

2003-10-17 10:23  jasper

	* sbin/lget, usr/share/man/man8/lget.8: Updating lget and manpage
	for -a/--all option

2003-10-10 21:36  hardkrash

	* var/lib/lunar/protected: added another config file to the list

2003-10-07 05:24  elaine

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/kernel.lunar: corrected variable case
	typo

2003-10-07 05:18  elaine

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/kernel.lunar: Changed backup_mods_krnl to
	only take kernel name and bootconfig functions to sycronize with
	bkup assuming in all places to use convention
	<kernel-version>-<module-identifier> where this string should match
	the version-extraversion id in the kernl Makefile

2003-10-06 02:08  elaine

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/kernel.lunar: Added installwatch
	frobbing, hacked and added grub and lilo stanza makers (w/
	whitespace now) and fixed copyright info.
