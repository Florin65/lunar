	var/lib/lunar/menu/mirrors.menu: Merging theedge into lunar! =^D

	* var/lib/lunar/sustained: Sorry for the gpm fans, but gpm is *NOT*
	a vital package for the correct functioning of lunar. Removing it
	here.

2003-01-19 23:14  sofar

	* etc/lunar/mirrors/LRESORT: Popping in DNS names!

2003-01-16 00:09  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/compilers/: c++, cc, g++, gcc: Merging theedge
	compiler wrappers into lunar.

2003-01-05 20:31  sofar

	* etc/lunar/config: New default LRESORT URL.

2003-01-05 20:29  sofar

	* etc/lunar/mirrors/LRESORT: Putting new source caches in here.

2003-01-01 23:24  sofar

	* sbin/lin: Removing autopatch scheme

2003-01-01 21:31  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/updatelog.lunar: This should fix the
	weird messages after a lunar update/renew

2002-12-30 22:19  hardkrash

	* sbin/lget: Added ability to use tun devices for internet
	connections. -- Hardkrash

2002-12-29 23:42  sofar

	* etc/lunar/config: Added PATCH_URL to config, the new repository
	for patches.

2002-12-24 18:20  tchan

	* var/lib/lunar/: subroutines, functions/optimize.lunar,
	menu/optimize.menu: Synched some more important fixes from theedge
	back into regular lunar core.

2002-12-23 01:10  sofar

	* sbin/lin: okay this works now without CVS bullocking it.

2002-12-23 01:07  sofar

	* sbin/lin: leave out the * to omit subdirs in case of CVS.

2002-12-23 00:49  sofar

	* sbin/lin: Added auto-patching: scan for subdir 'patch' and apply
	all regular files in that directory before BUILD/default_build.
	Note patch order is equal to 'ls'.

2002-12-22 06:38  tchan

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Bringing some of the added
	functionality from theedge back into lunar core.  Specifically the
	patch_it function which is appearing in more of moonbase.  Also
	added the fixes from theedge for the disappearing
	/usr/share/info/dir file.  Added the timestamp feature in the
	activity_log from theedge.

2002-11-26 14:49  kc8apf

	* lib/lsb/init-functions: Fix pgrep so it only finds processes that
	start with PROCESS.  It was previously finding any process which
	contained PROCESS, so kapmd was found when apmd was the process
	being searched for.

2002-11-21 05:31  hardkrash

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: Added PPC and Power
	options to lunar optomization functions

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/updatelog.lunar: 
	fixed typo MOUDLE caught by Lurch, and added "" to the variables --
	this (variable quoting) probably needs to be done for all lunar
	code
