	var/lib/lunar/functions/misc.lunar: few simple download fixes.

2003-04-28 18:57  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/moonbase.lunar: fix for old
	moonbase.tar.bz2 flying around in /tmp (we really need to move
	everything out of /tmp), and better consistent install log creation
	(with neat trick)

2003-04-27 23:13  sofar

	* sbin/lin, var/lib/lunar/functions/optimize.lunar: narrowing this
	down to the absolute minimum, making the code much more simple.

	too...

2003-04-23 21:19  sofar

	* etc/lunar/config: Adding all safe lunar mirrors as MOONBASE_URL,
	this allows dk.lunar-linux to take over in case the main site is

	* var/lib/lunar/: subroutines, functions/prune.lunar: Moving prune

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: BIG BIG BIG bugfix: lunar
	will now better find moved modules (umm, I say better, but I mean
	actually that lunar now actually finds them. I dunno what is better
	than that, so yeah, better).

2003-03-24 00:13  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: muuuuuch better

2003-03-23 23:43  sofar

	* sbin/lget, sbin/lin, var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/postbuild.lunar: deprecated use_cvs and the
	CVS_MODULE scheme, CVS is now 100% transparent. Hope to merge these
