	* var/lib/lunar/functions/sources.lunar: Adding sha1: verify syntax
	  code that uses sha1sum, slightly better than md5sum (what is it
	  again, 160 bits against 128 hash size?). The code hooks up
	  seamlessly and as demonstrated the older core doesn't break if it
	  doesn't handle the sha1: syntax. sha1sum is provided by coreutils
	  BTW so must in any case be present on all boxes, I don't expect
	  any box to fail on that.
