	* var/lib/lunar/excluded: protect the whole dir instead of 4 files.

2003-03-06 22:44  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/useradd.lunar: this is badly needed,
	considering adding this to lunar ASAP...

2003-03-05 23:19  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/: subroutines, functions/depends.lunar: More
	merging out of grouped functions: depends functions all now reside
	in depends.lunar

2003-03-05 22:57  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: show difference between optional and
	required depends.

2003-02-28 00:25  sofar

	* sbin/lget, var/lib/lunar/functions/download.lunar: code cleanups:
	lget!
	
	- moved general functions into functions/download.lunar -
	structured code, no weird function names - molecularized code:
	download_module, get_url, become more atomic functions and less
	vague.	- made lget a dummy frontend, as it should be. lin may
	possibly completely skip lget now and run a download process
	internally.

2003-02-26 22:43  sofar

	* sbin/lrm, var/lib/lunar/subroutines,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Fixing the 'double module'
	bug I've been having and that might have occurred on some systems
	unnoticed. All module functions have been armed against possible
	packages corruption by a crashed lrm (where the packages file
	wasn't updated correctly).

2003-02-25 23:52  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: bugfix #199: remove_depends $MODULE
	will also remove OPTIONAL depends on $MODULE, so lin will prompt
	again if you want to install it or not.

2003-02-25 19:35  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: This is slightly too much IMO

2003-02-25 08:44  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: hmm, this seems more logical.

2003-02-24 22:55  sofar

	* sbin/lget, sbin/lin, sbin/lrm, var/lib/lunar/subroutines,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/edit.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/messages.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/postbuild.lunar: large rewrite of verbose
	messages:
	
	- verbose_msg is now a main function - the function always returns
	true hence fixing the wiped depends problem - migrated all calls to
	new scheme - split up lunar messages functions to messages.lunar -
	split up editing functions to edit.lunar - made lrm slightly less
	verbose

2003-02-24 20:01  kc8apf

	* var/lib/lunar/excluded: Add mailman site config to excluded

2003-02-22 20:26  csm

	* var/lib/lunar/excluded: adding a fe wmore files to the list

	* sbin/lget: verbosity, better separating cvs/non-cvs.

2003-02-22 11:55  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: More verbosity in core functions:
	depends and optional_depends are much more verbose now.

2003-02-21 00:00  sofar

	* sbin/lin, var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Multiple fixes:
	
	* KEEP_SOURCE implemented in rm_source_dir for transparancy *
	verbose error handling of multiple stages within lin (more needed
	but this covers pretty much all cutomizable scripts) * adding
	better logging which shows the failed section. (all devs shout "we
	always wanted that!") * turned my alarm on and went to bed

2003-02-20 21:36  sofar

	* bin/lvu: echo .......... echo

2003-02-20 00:24  sofar

	* sbin/lin, var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Fix #247:
	
	- .iw file was being remove too much (only needed prior to starting
	and after finishing) - compile log was being viewed before it was
	generated.

2003-02-19 23:42  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/updatelog.lunar: Major rewrite: strickter
	var handling, better constricted code. Hope this kills the errors!

2003-02-19 21:19  tchan

	* var/lib/lunar/excluded: Removed /devices.  It is no longer needed
	and should not be on any Lunar boxes anymore.

2003-02-19 20:57  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/sources.lunar: eep! run_details should
	ALWAYS be between ()'s

2003-02-19 20:25  sofar

	* bin/lvu: yeah yeah this is quick.

2003-02-18 15:16  sofar

	* bin/lvu: Sheez what a mess.

2003-02-18 15:08  sofar

	* bin/lvu: Failed compile logs should be displayed if available of
	newer versions instead of older compile logs of installed versions.

2003-02-18 14:28  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/sources.lunar: Fix for lvu prune removing
	CVS sources.

	around the lunar.

2003-02-15 20:51  sofar

	* sbin/lget: CVS fixed that were needed. let's not spend too much
	time here.

2003-02-15 20:09  sofar

	* sbin/lin, sbin/lrm, var/lib/lunar/subroutines,
	var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar: Fix for (1) tar error on
	cache, removed --verbose from lrm, cleaned up more code, unified
	verbose messages.
	
	Also, the remove_module which people assumed to be removed
	incedentally was removed again, since the call is made by lrm
	(l228,l296). PLEASE LEAVE IT OUT NOW, since doing this belongs in
	the lrm code.

2003-02-14 15:52  tchan

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Added back in the "missing" call to
	remove_modules.  I believe it is still required and was removed by
	sofar accidentally in his clean up.

2003-02-14 00:06  sofar

	* sbin/lin, sbin/lunar, var/lib/lunar/excluded,
	var/lib/lunar/subroutines, var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar:
