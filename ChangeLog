	* var/state/lunar/blacklist.x86: Removed ddd from the blacklist.  It now correctly compiles with gcc-3.2.

	* var/lib/lunar/subroutines: Fixed a long standing bug on why the /usr/share/info/dir file keeps getting
	trashed.  prepare_install was not saving /usr/share/info/dir and that file
	is being tracked by installwatch so it becomes part of the tar.bz2 file.
	So inside prepare_install, if the module is already installed, it removes
	the existing module before completing the install.  This would remove
	the exisiting /usr/share/info/dir and then replace it with a very short
	version of /usr/share/info/dir.

	* var/state/lunar/: blacklist.x86, gcc.x86: Removing gcc.x86 list (unused)
	Adding blacklist.x86 with contents:
	  ddd
	  rythmbox
	  gstreamer

	* sbin/lin: Fixed the issue with --fix installing "held" modules.  this will no longer happen.
	Added support for a "blacklist" again it is still in /var/state/lunar, but the aname has changed to blacklist.$PLATFORM (defaults to x86).  This will NOT let a blacklisted module install at all and terminates lin when a blacklisted module is encountered.  I realize this could cause issues, and I am looking for a better solution... feel free to post ideas.
