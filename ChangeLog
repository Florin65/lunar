	* var/lib/lunar/: functions/optimize.lunar, menu/optimize.menu:
	  Merging linker optimizations

2004-10-06 15:27  sofar

	* lib/lsb/init-functions: AAARGH important bugfix that affects
	  /etc/init.d/network!

2004-10-06 12:43  sofar

	* sbin/lin, var/lib/lunar/functions/modules.lunar,
	  var/lib/lunar/functions/sources.lunar: Adding -w|--want $VERSION
	  support (NO WARRANTY) that allows you to override VERSION (don't
	  try this with more than one module ;^))

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/main.lunar: #452: force double checking
	  on $LUNAR_MODULE with some msgs.

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/main.lunar: #341: explicitly omit core
	  code and moonbase during rebuild

2004-09-26 15:36  sofar

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/sources.lunar: fix for #433: This resets
	  the owner and strips setGid and setUid bits on files while
	  extracting them. As a proper precaution this should always
	  happen. I am confident this will fix a lot of other problems in
	  the future.

	* sbin/lrm: bugfix #460 (tested). I forgot to add the "optimize"
	  call since BUILD is no longer set by default. Also some leftover
	  and untested code after cleaning up probably.

	* bin/lvu: The error message received when doing 'lvu size
	  AModuleThatIsNotInstalled' was not displaying the incorrect
	  module name as intended.  This is because it was using the wrong
	  variable to get the module name.  Now it should be using the
	  right variable.

	* usr/share/man/man8/lrm.8: Adding purge to man page

	* var/lib/lunar/protected: Smacking courier in here

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/sources.lunar: foo /me fixes proper
	  comments

	* var/lib/lunar/functions/sources.lunar: Adding sha1: verify syntax
	  code that uses sha1sum, slightly better than md5sum (what is it
	  again, 160 bits against 128 hash size?). The code hooks up
	  seamlessly and as demonstrated the older core doesn't break if it
	  doesn't handle the sha1: syntax. sha1sum is provided by coreutils
	  BTW so must in any case be present on all boxes, I don't expect
	  any box to fail on that.

	* etc/lunar/mirrors/LRESORT: badly needed update

2004-08-22 11:34  perldude

	* etc/lunar/mirrors/SFORGE: added german SF mirror. I'm using it
	  for some time now. No problems.
